              "  'answer': 'A proxy server is a system or router that provides a gateway between users and the internet. Therefore, it helps prevent cyber attackers from entering a private network. It is a server, referred to as an “intermediary” because it goes between end-users and the web pages they visit online.\\n When a computer connects to the internet, it uses an IP address. This is similar to your home’s street address, telling incoming data where to go and marking outgoing data with a return address for other devices to authenticate. A proxy server is essentially a computer on the internet that has an IP address of its own.\\n How a Proxy Works\\nBecause a proxy server has its own IP address, it acts as a go-between for a computer and the internet. Your computer knows this address, and when you send a request on the internet, it is routed to the proxy, which then gets the response from the web server and forwards the data from the page to your computer’s browser, like Chrome, Safari, Firefox, or Microsoft Edge\\n Benefits of a Proxy Server\\n Enhanced security: Can act like a firewall between your systems and the internet. Without them, hackers have easy access to your IP address, which they can use to infiltrate your computer or network.\\n Private browsing, watching, listening, and shopping: Use different proxies to help you avoid getting inundated with unwanted ads or the collection of IP-specific data.\\n Access to location-specific content: You can designate a proxy server with an address associated with another country. You can, in effect, make it look like you are in that country and gain full access to all the content computers in that country are allowed to interact with.\\n'},\n",

My sin, my soul”.\\n 1984 - George Orwell: “It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen”.\\n Pride and Prejudice - Jane Austen: “It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife”.\\n But the most memorable opening lines, which is my all-time favorite is:\\n A Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens: \" It was the best of times, it was the worst of times; it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness; it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity; it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness; it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair; we had everything before us, we had nothing before us; we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way.\"\\n'},\n",

By this time, the iconic clock tower announces, quite loudly, “NIT - the pride of India, vande mataram. The time is: six o'clock.” This is followed by six chimes and effectively acts as my alarm everyday.\\n(that's the culprit)\\n Shortly after this I finish off whatever I have to finish every morning, relishing the only time Trichy as a city is bearably cool. Once I'm done with everything, which is by around 7:00 am, I laze around in bed on my phone catching up on the day’s news and checking the forecast (in vain) for some rain. By 7:45 am, I change into something more ‘appropriate’ for class and head downstairs to the mess for breakfast.\\n At breakfast, I avoid the bread because for some reason it vaguely tastes like coconut. I eat the rubbery dosa, or the bland, uncooked poha or whatever there is because apparently breakfast is the most important meal of the day and I don't exactly have any other choice. Then I quickly drink tea and rush out of the mess by 8:15 am.\\n From the mess it's directly off to the LHC (Lecture Hall Complex) which I reach by 8:20 am, since it's barely a five minute walk from the mess. I go early because I get to relish the AC in the classroom. We have our lectures from 8:30 am to 12:10 pm, with a 20-minute short break after the first two classes. This is the point where we wonder why we chose this life in the first place, and why we have to learn the basics of all the engineering disciplines when we've already chosen one as our branch.\\n From 12:10 pm to 1:30 pm, it's our official lunch break. I prefer going to the mess and getting done with the meal as soon as I can (it's more of a chore than something I look forward to) before going to my room to relax until 1:20 pm or so. Then I rush to the LHC if there's a theory class, or go to Ojas (the Sciences block) for labs, cursing myself for not getting a cycle. Labs are quite variable and can end anywhere between 3:00–5:00 pm. After that, I go to the mess for snacks, if decent (a samosa or a cutlet, maybe) or back to my room.\\n From 5:30 pm to 6:30 pm I usually watch a show on Prime Video, and around 6:30 pm I start to try to finish my work for the day, like records, assignments, or suggested reading. Then, around 7:30 pm, I go downstairs to either the mess or A2C (an extremely cheap restaurant) for dinner.\\n I'm usually back to my room by 9:00 pm after giving biometric attendance. If I have a dreaded Cycle Test the next day, this is when I resort to reading textbooks or watching YouTube tutorials, and if I'm free, I continue to watch shows on Prime till around 12:00 am. I end up doing the latter even if there's a CT, and I'm racked with guilt, so to cope, I watch another episode. It's a nice, vicious cycle.\\n I sleep by 12:30 am maximum on weekdays.\\n I haven't mentioned the occasional classes being cancelled, Maggi at Aavin/Bru, sessions of soda at the Coke Station, long hours staring at the screen fooling myself that I'm being productive at the 24x7 Octagon Computer Center, and the sheer amount of non-academic activities on campus (clubs, symposiums) that break the monotony. Not to mention the fests like Festember, Aaveg and Pragyan that make enduring the academics worth it (very often looked forward to just for the food).\\n(yeah, I just stole those from my Instagram)\\nAll in all, a typical day at NITT for a freshman is packed, and yet most of us manage to find time to be unproductive despite it.\\n\"},\n",

Standard means whatever the majority has decided is the normal thing to do, and ethical conduct is an agreed upon set of rules everyone chooses to follow.\\n Therefor, whatever is obligated goes WAY BEYOND whatever is standard. This means everything and not just ethics.\\n Ethics are a set of agreed upon rules that everyone chooses to follow in order to keep the peace in any group (family, society, work, gathering, etc.). Sort of like going to a family reunion where no one gets along. Everyone agrees to be on their best behavior even though they would rather torment each other. Following some basic ethics (keep your bad thoughts to yourself, be polite, do not talk about stuff that starts fights, etc.) will allow all these people to have a good time, and keep those negative feelings from causing problems. When different social groups come together having an agreed upon set of ethics, that all choose to follow, will help reduce conflicts.\\n'},\n",

Point is, this person is squarely within the class of people who “might\" do the above.\\n Maybe a month ago, this friend and I were talking about a legal issue in a particular legal case. How a certain motion would be decided. In which the litigant asked for a particular remedy. (Which, in my view, was very unwise.)\\n My friend was insistent that the motion should be decided in one particular way because that was the best and most just result for that litigant.\\n I responded that, this simply isn\\'t how judges decide questions. As a rough template, they look at the facts, the law of the case, what the motion asks the judge to do, and the standard (usually determined in previous cases) for making any particular decision. There are reasons judges deviate from this--but that\\'s sort of the place you start from.\\n And in this particular case, the remedy was something that a sensible judge would probably not entertain because it “went too far\", would prolong the dispute, involved the court too much in trying to monitor the parties, and there was just nothing in the statute which governed the case covering this unusual request.\\n My friend disagreed. Because the judge should do X. It made sense to him, so that was what should be done.\\n …\\n One do the skills that lawyers must develop is separating (1) advocacy for some cause, from (2) what anticipated outcomes might be reasonable or more probable.\\n This is not as simple as it sounds. There are many unwritten rules and practices. Things that people care about when making decisions. Ways that parties lie or are less than honest. Patterns that recur over and over again. Without guidance, it would be quite difficult to bring yourself up to a seasoned practitioner in… many many years.\\n'},\n",

Anonymous Proxy\\n While accessing the online websites the Anonymous Proxies provide the fake IP address to the websites instead of your actual website address.\\n Anonymous proxies provide more control over your online identity because it hides your IP address but your connection is not as much as private in the VPN.

Distorting Proxy\\n Distorting proxy introduced itself as proxy service to the website and hides the actual information of proxy in use and provide the fake information. The distorting proxy is very useful where the user wants to hide their information as well as the proxy information. It is generally used by the user to access the web resources of other countries.\\n 4. High Anonymity Proxy\\n High Anonymity proxy server provides the advance lever to privacy and security. Not only they hide the IP address and other information, but they can also hide as a proxy server.\\n They continue to change the IP address periodically and make the web server feel like there is no proxy service working for behalf of the user.\\n High Anonymity proxies are used where privacy and security are a big concern because it is the most secure proxy service.\\n [LINKED_TEXT: What is Proxy Server | Types and Advantages?] [URL: https://routebig.com/what-is-proxy-server/]\\n'},\n",

              " {'question': 'Why do conspiracy theorists need to believe in their theories?',\n",
              "  'answer': 'For many, diverse reasons.\\n For one thing, our minds are designed to try to find order even when there isn’t any. That’s why such phenomena as pareidolia (e.g. seeing a face appear among the random dots on a floor tile) exist.\\n So one of the attractive things about conspiracy theories is that they provide a sense of meaning and order behind the chaos of life, current events, etc. So a pandemic for some can turn into attempts by Bill Gates to promote 5G. Even such an inherently insane, unevidenced claim has appeal to some because it’s more comfortable to believe everything is part of the plan than what is best summed up as “shit happens”. It also gives people something to actually rail against and protest against, vs adopting the feeling that they are helplessly and futilely being cast about by the whims of chance.\\n Sometimes it offers a simple explanation to something that has complex, interacting causes. It is simplistic thinking that allows one to think an unsusual snowstorm is more important evidence than complex interactions between global warming, climate systems, ocean currents, etc, or to ignore data showing worldwide warming trends. Local weather is a simple, visceral experience.\\n And it can give someone a sense of superiority over others that they might otherwise lack. It’s a bit like “I may never have done well in school or gotten a good job, but I’m still smarter than you sheeple and them-there scientists.” Etc. It’s like the many irrational bigots on Quora who go around accusing others of being irrational bigots. And all evidence to the contrary of their beliefs becomes more evidence, instead, of The Big Conspiracy or The Big Homogenous Mass With Faults That Isn’t Me. How does your local GP whose wife died from cancer benefit from covering up the Cure? Who the hell knows, but the conspiracy theorist who also lost a wife to cancer will still be angry at that GP, because, god forbid that people are just sometimes powerless.\\n And in some cases it gives people a scapegoat. “The reason I never did well is because the Man kept me down”. So you have Incels blaming everyone else for their lack of personality, poor hygiene, etc. And it is why governments like blaming the latest boogeyman (one minority or another) for their own failure to solve every problem, while blaming opposition parties for failing to solve Every Problem Ever including cancer or 3000 years of war — so they can get re-elected.\\n That said, the world is actually full of conspiracies, from the small scale (a group of friends getting together to plan a prank) to the large scale. So it is sometimes a bit too easy to believe in conspiracies that only exist in one’s mind.\\n After all, a complete lack of belief in conspiracies may be just a delusional as a belief in a particular conspiracy.\\n You do have groups of politicians getting together and figuring out that the way around equal rights laws is to come up with something like Jim Crow laws. Or that the way to get around the popular vote is to engage in gerrymandering. The US government did really experiment on people (MK-Ultra, the Tuskegee Airmen). People with connections have really conspired to allow people to get away with murder (lynchings of blacks). There really were Russian spies in the US in the 1950s (although Joe McCarthy started a total witch hunt over it in order to promote himself). And there are some major conspiracies that are taught in schools (the Boston Tea Party), and some that have had a profound effect upon large populations.\\n There are even conspiracies that involve making people believe in false conspiracies. In early 20th century Russia, for example, anti-semites managed to create the false belief in a world-wide conspiracy of Jews by fabricating the document The Protocols of the Elders of Zion. Henry Ford of Ford Motor Company fame got ahold of a copy eventually, bought into it, published it in his Dearborn Independent gazette and otherwise transmitted it to others, including Adolph Hitler who praised Ford in his book Mein Kampf. There are many other examples of such deliberate disinformation where people ironically form a belief in ideas or even conspiracies while being a victim of a conspiracy themselves. Result? The deaths of millions of innocent Jews in Russia and Europe.\\n Which goes to show you have your Alan Joneses, KKK members, neo-Nazis, and others who are just plain racist, bigoted, sexist, profit-seeking users and abusers who find utility in promoting conspiracies.\\n And sometimes people are, quite simply, correct. No, NOT flat-earthers, or anti-vaxxers or people denying the moon landing or global warming. They’re completely delusional. But, per above, conspiracies do actually exist, and those who uncover them may be doing the world a huge service by doing so. Whether it is exposing industrial pollutors, government abuses, or whatever else. And that drive to do something good may in fact be the driving force behind some conspiracy theorists.\\n'},\n",

              "  'answer': 'Why are scientists more concerned about the impact of CO2 in the atmosphere than water vapor?\\n Water vapour might be the major contributor to the greenhouse effect, but the only way water vapour will increase and push temperatures up further is for there to be an initial increase in temperature. That initial increase has to come from something else such as an increase in CO2 or in solar activity. What we’ve seen since industrialisation and especially since the 1970s is a huge increase in our emissions. This is what is driving temperature change. Temperatures have risen a degree since the 1970s. And it’s not natural because solar activity is falling and the environment adds and takes out CO2 in roughly equal amounts; we only add it, thus the large increase. In fact, it’s increasing about 100 times faster than coming out of the last glacial period.\\n Studies have found that for every degree increase in temperatures from our CO2 causes another degree increase due to the increase in water vapour (because warming means more evaporation, thus more water vapour in the air). Given it’s about a 1:1 relationship. An increase in CO2 comes first then temperature increase. For water vapour, it’s the other way round: temperature increases first, then water vapour. When you look at what’s actually causing temperatures to increase, water vapour drops out as per the diagram below. This is why scientists are more concerned about CO2 (and methane) than water vapour.\\n'},\n",

It can be moved between our head and feet.\\n When the point of contraction is above the level of the top of our head our sense organs work independent of each other. However, if the point of contraction is below the level of the top of our head, our sense organs merge into a unified sense organ, called Third eye. Now, we can feel, or see with our Third eye, the minutest changes that occur in the tones of the various levels of the unified muscle.\\n Also, we feel that the power supply of all of our thoughts merge into a unified power supply, called soul.\\nNow we reduce the power supply to the least by lowering the point of contraction to the level of the feet, then raise it to various levels.

There are lakhs of Civil Engineering students graduating every year all around the Globe, so here differents types of question arises:-\\n Is is possible to give job to each and every Civil Engineer who graduates?\\n Is every Civil Engineer is worth to get a good job?\\n Is the Civil engineer who is getting job is proficient in his/her field?\\n Lets talk about the condition of Civil Engineers in India and about their placements.\\n Do you know most of the core Civil companies prefer candidates who have a rich experience.\\n Even if you are studying in good private college their is few changes that you will get placed and will earn good package, except IIT’s , NIT’s.\\n Condition of India is such that in 83% of colleges , Civil Engineering companies are not coming for placement because everyone wants candidate who have rich experience and if in some case you are lucky enough than they will offer you very low package (except IIT’s and NIT’s).\\n This is the total loss of students they get frustrated as they are not able to get job , whereever they go they are asking for experience and if this is not enough some consultants are asking you to pay some amount of money and promising you to give job and later you come to know that it was just a fraud.Now most of the students try to escape from this situation they change their respective field or sometimes go for MBA or any higher studies. They also try for Bank Po exam as number of engineering students are increasing comparatively each and every year as they are left with no option other than this.\\n They also try to join some new and small scale industries in order to gain experience. The circle goes like this and seems to be never ending. The only solution for this is Study hard or gain some experience from small scale Employers , try uploading your Resume to company websites only, regularly check for government exams because they never ask you for experience other than qualifying examination or clear Exams like GATE, IES and then you need not to be worried ever for your future.\\n Moreover, you can follow my Youtube channel to learn about Railway and Metro construction in India\\n'},\n",

One major event in history that changed the world as we know it today was the Partition of the Indian subcontinent. I would probably like to go back to the time when India was being partitioned and try to change that. Nothing lies to you more than History textbooks in school. If you get a chance to read the documents of Britishers from that time, you will understand that the real reason for partition was not because India was too large a country to be governed by the new government but was a result of a domestic dispute.\\nApparently, both Mohammad Ali Jinnah and Jawaharlal Nehru wanted to become the first Prime Minister. Since that was not possible and Nehru wasn’t keen on giving up his personal interests, Jinnah demanded a separate country and he would become the Prime Minister of the new one while Nehru will the Prime Minister of the existing country. It was Gandhi Ji who came up with the idea of partition and the same got approval from the British. Had one of the two given up their desire to become the first Prime Minister, we probably would have been living in undivided India. The logic that India was too large to be governed is just a rumour since Australia gained independence around the same time and even though it was larger than India, that wasn’t partitioned.\\nHad we lived in undivided India, a lot of domestic disputes could have been solved automatically. The military could focus on its immediate threat - China and need not worry about Pakistan. The issue of Kashmir would not have seen the light of the day. India could have afforded to lessen its annual military budget and utilised it in other development activities for the upliftment of the nation. It is a pity how power-hungry people are ready to sacrifice the entire nation and its people just to satisfy their personal greed. Had one of them acted sensibly, the issue could have been resolved. Therefore, if I have the chance to go back to the past and rewrite history, I will try to change this part.\\n'},\n",

It is beating, always. The second, it stops, the life of the person flies away. It is the same with the entrepreneurship. You, the entrepreneur- is the 'heart' of your entrepreneurship. The second you stop, the life of your project is done!\\n Working as diligently as a human heart- no complaints, no strikes, no year-end reviews, no performance bonus, no applause, no recognition, No- nothing. But, you do the work- as a silent, efficient heart! Pushing the life blood all through the veins of your entrepreneurship, making every adjustment possible, along the way, if possible.\\n Not everyone, is ready for that kind of commitment. It is deep, dedicated and diligent work- the mindset of an entrepreneur- that brings out a fantastic project to glowing recognition!\\n Examples- so many. Whether it is Walt Disney, Andrew Carnegie, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Steve Jobs or Mark Zuckerberg.\\n The entrepreneurial mindset!\\nImage credits-[LINKED_TEXT: Heart - Wikipedia] [URL: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart]\\n All the very best!

              " {'question': 'What wind speed cancel flights? What is the highest wind speed in which a plane can land?',\n",
              "  'answer': 'There is no single maximum wind speed that cancels flights, as it depends on the direction of wind and phase of flight. A crosswind above about 40mph and a tailwind above 10mph can start to cause problems and stop commercial jets from taking off and landing.\\nA crosswind is a wind that blows across the runway, perpendicular to the direction of the aircraft’s movement. A crosswind can make it difficult for the pilot to align the aircraft with the runway and maintain directional control during take-off and landing. A crosswind above 30-35 kts (about 34-40 mph) is considered restrictive for take-off and landing.\\n A tailwind is a wind that blows in the same direction as the aircraft’s movement. A tailwind can increase the ground speed of the aircraft during take-off and landing, which means it needs more runway distance to accelerate or decelerate. A tailwind above 10-15 kts (about 11-17 mph) is considered limiting for take-off and landing.\\nThe highest wind speed that a plane can land in also depends on other factors such as:\\nA headwind is beneficial for take-off and landing, as it reduces the ground speed and increases the lift of the aircraft. It can also help stabilize the aircraft against gusts or turbulence. A headwind that is too strong can cause excessive airspeed or stall conditions.A gust is a sudden increase or decrease in wind speed or direction. It can cause variations in airspeed, lift, drag, and thrust, which can affect the stability and control of the aircraft. It can also make it harder for the pilot to judge the approach speed and flare timing during landing.The condition of the runway surface can affect the friction and braking of the aircraft during take-off and landing. A wet or contaminated runway can reduce friction and increase the stopping distance of the aircraft. A wet or contaminated runway can also reduce the maximum allowable crosswind or tailwind limits.Visibility is the distance at which an object can be seen clearly in daylight or at night. Visibility can be affected by weather conditions such as fog, rain, snow, or dust. Low visibility can make it difficult for the pilot to see the runway lights, markings, or other traffic during take-off and landing. Low visibility can also require special procedures or equipment such as instrument landing systems (ILS) or enhanced vision systems (EVS).\\nIf you love reading this answer, kindly upvote :)\\n'},\n",
              " {'question': 'How do I invest $20000 USD in the best possible way?',\n",
              "  'answer': 'I will choose to invest in the Stock Market with such amount,\\nGuide on how to invest on international stocks:\\n1. Contact a stockbroker: This is the most common way to invest in foreign stocks, as most Nigerian banks have relationships with global stockbrokers who can facilitate transactions. Stockbrokers are financial professionals who work in brokerage firms or other financial institutions, executing orders in the market on behalf of clients.\\n To contact one, you may start your research online and gather a list of brokers or reach out to friends and network who may be able to help. Once you have your list, set up a meeting with each of them and ask them questions about their services, how they work, what their fees are, etc. After you’ve met with them all, decide which one you want to work with and sign up for an account.\\n For most of the stock brokerage firms, they have limited amounts to start with. With Risevest, a a dollar-investment company, an investor can begin with as low as $1 to begin, this remove the barrier of entry for everyone who wants in invest in foreign assets\\n 2. Sign up for an online trading account: A growing number of Nigerian investors are using online trading platforms like Risevest and Bamboo to buy and sell foreign stocks. This option may be more convenient and offer better prices than working with a stockbroker.\\n While this may sound like a great way to invest your funds, here are some of the demerits of using this option to invest in foreign stocks:\\n a. Lack of knowledge and experience – Trading stocks is a skill that takes time and practice to master. If you are new to the stock market, it is important to do your research and learn about the different strategies that can help you make money. .\\n b. High risk – Trading stocks is a high risk investment and there is always the potential for losses. Before making any trades, it is important to understand the risks involved and have a solid trading plan in place.\\n c. Time commitment – In order to be successful at trading stocks, you need to be able to dedicate time to monitoring the market and making trades. If you are unable to commit the time needed, it may be better to hire a professional trader.\\n d. Stressful – The stock market can be a volatile place and traders can often experience a lot of stress when making decisions about their investments. This can be especially harmful if you are not used to dealing with stress in your everyday life.\\n e. Expensive – Trading stocks can be expensive, especially if you are not doing it yourself. Commission fees from brokers can quickly add up, so it is important to find a broker that offers low commission rates.\\n However with a good financial investment advisor, You can help your investment grow and manage your money under the assistance of a professional mutual broker while investing on high-growth stocks across the US market with their firm equity portfolio of power stocks.\\n 3. Buy exchange-traded funds (ETFs): ETFs are funds that track specific indexes or baskets of securities, and many of them include foreign stocks. This can be a cost-effective way to get exposure to a number of different foreign markets.\\n If you want to buy US exchange-traded funds from any where in the world, you need to open a brokerage account with an international mutual financial investment broker like Victoria Grace Lindsay that offers access to those stock products. Once your account is open, you can transfer money from your bank account to the brokerage account and then use this money to purchase the ETFs that you are interested in.\\n When buying ETFs, it is important to consider the fees that will be charged. Most foreign brokers charge a commission on each transaction, as well as a yearly maintenance fee. Make sure you understand these fees and how they will impact your overall investment returns.\\nFinally, always remember to do your own research before investing in any product.\\nBelow are a few examples of popular US exchange-traded funds:\\n – SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY)\\n – Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI)\\n – iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM)\\n – WisdomTree Emerging Markets Equity Income Fund (DGS)\\n 4. Use mutual funds: Mutual funds also offer access to foreign stocks, and many of them have mandates that allow them to invest in companies from around the world. This can be a good way to diversify your portfolio across multiple geographies.\\n 6. Buy shares through an international broker: If you have a specific country or region that you want to invest in, you can often buy shares of individual companies through an international broker. This can be expensive and may not be as convenient as using other methods, but it can give you direct exposure to specific markets.\\n When it comes to buying shares through an international broker, there are a few key challenges that investors need to be aware of.\\n The first challenge is that many brokers have different rules when it comes to which countries they can do business in. This can make it difficult for investors to find a broker that is able to execute their trade.\\n The second challenge is that most international brokers charge higher fees than domestic brokers. This is because they have to account for the additional costs associated with doing business across borders.\\n Finally, investors need to be aware of the potential for currency fluctuations when buying shares through an international broker. This can cause the price of the shares to change unpredictably, which can be difficult to manage for investors who are not familiar with foreign markets.\\n 8. Consider alternative investments: Finally, there are a number of alternative investment options that can give you exposure to foreign stocks, such as venture capital funds, hedge funds and private equity investments.\\n You can begin immediately by opening a brokerage account with Victoria Grace Lindsay to help you purchase online stocks.\\n In three months, I accumulated a portfolio worth $8,000. I began working on this guide under the supervision of Victoria Grace Lindsay, a mutual-services broker.\\n If you wish to amass wealth, you can search for her on Google and other social platforms, including Reddit, Vocal.media, Instagram, and other informational platforms.\\n'},\n",

              "  'answer': \"The German invasion of France, during WWII. [LINKED_TEXT: Battle of France] [URL: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_France]\\n This was, in my opinion, the best plan the Germans applied during the war.\\n In the early days of WWII, Germany planned an invasion of France, with its goal being to force French surrender quickly, so that they could focus resources and troops elsewhere.\\n Unfortunately, in between Germany and Paris laid the Maginot Line: a defensive line of state of the art impenetrable bunkers and fortresses, all stocked full with artillery emplacements and troop barracks. In addition, the British Expaditionary Force (BEF) had set up shop up North in Belgium, blocking the path the German Army had taken 17 years prior in 1914, effectively stretching the Maginot Line from Germany’s southern border all the way to the Atlantic. They had every spot covered, save one.\\n The BEF failed to consider that Germany would be willing to send their troops through the Ardennes Forest.\\nGerman plan of attack for the Western Front.\\n Hence, the Ardennes Forest was left virtually unguarded, and the Germans exploited this advantage to the fullest.\\n The Germans launched two plans, Case Yellow, and Case Red.\\n Case Yellow was launched first, on the 10th of May, 1940. It's essential goal was to punch a deep hole in the Allied line, and separate the BEF, Belgian, and some French forces from the rest of the Maginot line.\\n Hitler, worried that the French armour reserves would mount a counterattack on the Panzer’s southern flank, sent orders through the German High Command to Erwin Rommel, telling him to halt his tanks and dig in. Fortunately for the Germans, Rommel ignored this order, and kept advancing deeper into Allied territory.\\n The Germans defeated Belgium in only a few days, which caused a problem for the Allies. Convinced the Germans were going to mount a frontal attack directly into Belgium, the Belgiums southern flank was exposed, and the German artillery and motorized infantry pummeled them into submission. The BEF and French divisions were counting on at least a week-long resistance by Belgium, and were so unprepared to secure a line to defend the southern flank.\\n Essentially, Case Yellow forced a hasty Allied retreat to Dunkirk (Dunkerque), and further separated the Allied forces from defending Paris or reinforcing the Maginot Line. (Hitler should've attacked the retreating Allied forces at Dunkirk, as without those hundreds of thousands of troops evacuated morale would've been low, and D-Day might not have even taken place.)\\n Case Red was essentially the clean up of the remaining French forces in France. This meant encircling the Maginot Line with a second German attack, and pushing further west and south to Paris. The French were unprepared for this method of Blitzkreig, or Lightning War, as the German strategy mainly revolved around quick advances, swift encirclements and mass surrenders.\\n The French were prepared for trench-style warfare, and so the highly mobilized German tactics caught them off guard, and so lead to the defeat of the French in little over a month.\\n Overall, the invasion plan of France was a very gutsy maneuver, and was successful both due to strategic risks that were taken, as well as risky but rewarding tactical decisions made by German generals and commanders. It's this that I think made it a very risky but very rewarding operation, (apart from letting the Allied troops retreat from Dunkirk to Great Britian).\\n\"},\n",

              "  'answer': 'No. Heisenberg’s uncertainty is limitation on the preparation of states. It says you cannot prepare a particle in a state such that it has both a definite momentum and a definite position at the same time. But it doesn’t prevent you measuring both the momentum and position of a particle to arbitrarily high precision yourself.\\n It is commonly misinterpreted as saying you cannot make a precise (i.e. to arbitrarily many decimal places) measurement of both the x-axis momentum and the position along the x-axis at the same time or on the same particle. This is untrue. It comes from confusing the concept of preparing particles in a state and measuring the state of a particle. Heisenberg actually contributed to this confusion with his microscope thought experiment.\\n The theory only says you cannot prepare a particle so that it has precise values of both momentum and position. The distinction is that you can measure both x and p and get precise values, but when you repeat the process with exactly the same preparation of the particle the measurement will yield different values. So even though you measure precise values there is no sense in which you can say the particle had those values independent of the measurement. And if you repeat the experiment many times, the scatter in the measured values will satisfy in the uncertainty principle. See Ballantine, *“Quantum Mechanics, A Modern Development”* pp 225–227 for more complete exposition.\\n To illustrate, you can prepare particles so that their position has only a small uncertainty and when you measure their position and momentum you will get a scatter plot like the blue points below.\\nEach point is a precise measurement of both momentum, p, and position, q. But because the scatter in position is small the scatter in momentum will be big - and the uncertainty principle will the satisfied. The red points illustrate the complementary case in which the particles have a small scatter in momentum, but a big scatter in position. The black points illustrate a preparation in which the momentum and position scatters are similar.\\n Incidentally, the inherent scatter imposed by Heisenberg’s uncertainty is for most purposes very small and, except in very precise laboratory measurements, is swamped by other sources of variability in measurements.\\n'},\n",

We got a call to the university from a taxi who had called in he had been attacked by a mob of people at the uni. No damage or injuries, just for our attention… We took the cell van. The majority of cars were next to useless driving around in snowy weather. So driving along the uni roads. No one around. In the distance we saw some makeshift barricade and drive a bit closer and as we rounded the corner we saw it.\\n At least 100 people, no cars, two high banks overlooking the road and 50 on each side armed to the teeth. I wasn’t driving. My colleague was. He stopped the van about 30 yards from the group who all stopped. 100 people armed with snowballs, and us. To be fair it did take about 20 seconds and about the same time I verbalised my thoughts. ‘Back up. Back up now’. My colleague said ‘uh?’ I repeated it as the first snow ball hit the roof, originating from the anonymity of being at the back. However, one was all that was needed. ‘Back the fuck up, now!’. As my colleague shifted into reverse, finally, it was raining heavy snow balls. The inside of the van sounded like 30 people were pounding on the outside, which is when I transmitted the update. Not the best timing as I might have sounded a little alarmed in my update during what sounded like a riot to my colleagues and radio operator. ‘We are withdrawing now. No one else comes up here. No one. Big crowd, we are the target, Tom, for fuck’s sake reverse faster please.’ (Just about sums up the update)\\n first and only time I have left an incident. We pulled over a mile away, stopped and drew breath. Lesson learnt, dont bugger around with 100+ students in the middle of a snowball fight by unifying them with a blue light target!\\n'},\n",

That’s when we’ll definitely want to be ensuring we’re attempting to recover the materials in it.\\n That said, it’s not so much the Si, but the other compounds that go along with it. As a base material Si is cheap and readily available. You’d still need to reprocess all the material and regrow Si substrates, etc. About the only thing you save energy on is extraction of some of the less common materials to be re-used from the old Solar Panels.\\n While at 25yrs they are probably going to be in the 80% of original efficiency for panels made in the early 2000’s, and closer to 90% of original efficiency of panels made today. It actually makes more sense to simply keep using the ones we have out there, unless for some reason we start to see lots of failures or we want to limit land usage and we can effectively double the energy output for the same land usage because of efficiency improvements. In such a case they could potentially be moved to 2nd life usage as well, which would be better EROI than recycling.\\n'},\n",

Vining (born August 12, 1950) is a retired sergeant major in the United States Army, who was one of the first members of Delta Force . He joined the Army in 1968, and served until 1999. Early life [ edit ] Mike Vining was born on August 12, 1950, in Greenville, Michigan, to Roger and Arlene Vining. [1] When he was in high school, he saw news of the Tet Offensive , which inspired him to join the military. [1] He graduated from Tri-County High School in 1968 and enlisted in the United States Army the same year. [1] Military career [ edit ] Vining completed the Army\\'s explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) program before being sent to Vietnam in 1970. He served in the 99th Ordnance Detachment for a year before being honorably discharged. [1] While in Vietnam, he was awarded the Bronze Star for \"meritorious service in ground operations and EOD duties\". [2] In 1973, he rejoined the Army, serving as an EOD specialist in the 63rd Ordnance Detachment at Fort Leonard Wood. [1] In 1978, he was assigned to Delta Force, a newly formed unit of which he was its first EOD specialist. [3] Vining served in Delta until 1985, taking part in Operation Eagle Claw and Operation Urgent Fury . [1] From 1985 to 1986, he was assigned to the 176th Ordnance Detachment in Alaska, before being brought back to Delta from 1986 to 1992, taking part in the Gulf War , Operation Uphold Democracy , and serving as an explosives expert during the 1996 Khobar Towers bombing .

Not all connections balance out in the current lifetime, which is why not all TF pairs achieve Union in this one lifetime. They might get a chance at it again in a future one, depending on their current soul contract and which lessons they came to learn in this lifetime.\\n Nothing harmful happens to the runner as such if they choose not to do the inner work, but depending on what their soul signed up to do in this lifetime, the Divine (God) may push them into a very violent DNOTS (more violent than the chaser’s) to force them into healing and leveling up. In this regard, it’s also to be noted that there’s a belief or mis-belief among some DFs that they can magically pull their DM along if they heal by themselves, since they believe this will heal the connection as a whole - that’s not really how it works, sorry. It’s as if you were a mother with a feverish baby and believed that drinking the medicine yourself would automatically heal the baby and nurse it back to health. See how improbable that sounds? The runner has to heal by themselves, but whether they do so or not is between them and God, not between the chaser and runner.\\n That said, I presume you’re referring to the DM as runner? While it’s true that the DM is indeed the initial runner, the DF (initial chaser) can become runner in turn too, once they stop chasing the DM and trigger separation. I’m the DF and I actually did this, and I can assure you that I’ve been forced to continue healing during my DM’s DNOTS. I did try to resist it in the initial weeks of turning runner, but I’ve been forced to look at it just as my DM has. My ego rose tremendously when I turned runner and I started blaming him for everything bad that had ever happened to me, but this only made me sad and bitter.

Watch as the Democrats pay down the debt, then rinse and repeat.\\n Here’s a big truth-the debt doesn’t really matter; only growth does, which shrinks the debt in relative proportion, which makes the economy a denominator issue.

              "  'answer': 'The 10 Roles of a Startup CEO\\n The measure of time you spend on every part will change each day, and it\\'ll unquestionably change contingent upon the phase of your business – for instance, you\\'ll invest significantly more energy in client support at $0/month than at $1M/month – yet the parts themselves are consistent.\\n 1) Recruiter\\n New businesses need individuals. Astonishing individuals.\\n At a greater organization, finding astonishing individuals is the all day occupation of multi-individual divisions.\\n At a startup, it falls on the CEO.\\n Everything from making sense of where your greatest needs are, to sorting through the weeds to discover unprecedented possibility to making sense of how you\\'re going to pay them, all falls under the part of the Recruiter.\\n In the event that you fall flat here, your startup will, as well.\\n 2) Cheerleader\\n In case you\\'re building something from nothing, there will be times when things suck. Not \"having an awful day\" suck, but rather \"the world is completion\" suck.\\n Your group, now and again, is going to feel like you have no shot at succeeding. Those are the minutes when regardless of whether you really do succeed is resolved. Keeping spirit high and keeping your group energized are basic to efficiency and development.\\n However, it\\'s not simply cheerleading amid the most exceedingly bad of times that is essential. Giving your group positive input and demonstrating to them the amount you value them is a significant part that should be filled each and every day in a startup CEO\\'s life.\\n 3) Coach\\n Pretty much as you have to demonstrate your group that they\\'re valued, you likewise need to push them to succeed. Incredible CEO\\'s are awesome mentors. They help their group set objectives, plan for the future and realign them when they veer off base. In the event that and when you don\\'t hit your objectives, you help everybody venture back and reassess what\\'s sensible and what should be possible better.\\n I\\'ve discovered that being available to the group and planning consistent one-on-one\\'s with each and every individual is a colossal variable in being a fruitful mentor. You can\\'t mentor a player unless you comprehend their abilities, objectives, difficulties and concerns. You must realize that about everybody.\\n 4) Dealmaker\\n Associations can be an effective approach to develop at any phase of your startup.\\n When you\\'re a startup, numerous organizations will just work with you on the off chance that they\\'re managing straightforwardly with the CEO. Having the capacity to offer the vision of your organization and the advantages of working with you to potential accomplices, much the same as you did with your clients, speculators and representatives, can prompt enormous helps in introduction and development for your business.\\n 5) Student\\n In case you\\'re not learning, you\\'re slowing down. Books, online journals, guides – these are all assets I wind up taking advantage of always to learn. It\\'s the place I get thoughts for everything from advertising and situating to item outline and administration.\\n Beside a modest rate of top CEO\\'s (who aren\\'t understanding this at any rate, since they don\\'t have to), it\\'s crazy to believe that you definitely know all that you have to know not an incredible CEO.\\n None of us do. Also, we probably never will. Since extraordinary CEO\\'s – the ones I respect most – know how much there still is left to learn.\\n 6) Firefighter\\n It\\'s unavoidable: there will be times when the serious trouble completely rises to the surface. A mammoth administration blackout. A PR emergency. A group issue. As the CEO, you\\'re an accessible as needs be firefighter, all day, every day. Regardless of what you\\'re doing when that happens, your occupation is to promptly get the hose and begin putting out the flame. And afterward enhancing that some portion of your business so it can\\'t burst into flames once more.\\n 7) Strategist\\n n a startup, a lot of your day is spent impeded in strategies. Be that as it may, while strategies can drive little everyday wins, methodology is the thing that advises those strategies and at last fills long haul development.\\n That is the reason as CEO, one of your parts is to purposely require some investment to consider procedure from a 40,000-foot viewpoint.\\n Where might you want to be in 12 months? In five years? Also, what are the master plan key choices you have to make (and moves you have to make) to arrive?\\n 8) Salesperson\\n From the principal day that you bring forth your thought, you turn into a sales representative. You offer to speculators, to enlisted people, to accomplices, to clients, to influencers and to any other person who can help you develop.\\n Regardless of the fact that you \"despise deals,\" you\\'re doing it, and showing signs of improvement at it is one of the greatest influence focuses you have.\\n 9) Customer Support Champion\\n In the event that your clients don\\'t succeed, you don\\'t, either. In the most punctual days, your part as bolster champion means holding each client\\'s hand as they battle through your unrefined model. It implies listening hard and learning all that you can about your clients\\' needs, difficulties, fears and trusts. It means being the voice of the client in each item improvement meeting, and assembling the criticism you have to settle on shrewd choices about the fate of the organization.\\n The client improvement side of things never stops, and the one-on-one ticket backing may back off, however that shouldn\\'t totally stop, either. The absolute most profitable bolster I ever did was burning through 20 hours every week doing client advancement when we were at that point surrounding $100K in MRR.\\n 10) Decider\\n A standout amongst the most hazardous spots for a startup to be is in examination limbo. At the point when the group can\\'t meet up and settle on a choice, everything backs off, and that is not a state you can stay in and plan to survive. As the CEO, you\\'ll have to venture in and settle on troublesome choices. Now and again, they\\'ll separate the group, or irritate clients. Also, you\\'ll need to make sense of how to settle it and proceed onward. It\\'s presumably the part of being CEO that I like slightest, but on the other hand it\\'s the part where you likely have the most effect.\\n'},\n",

Koreans are very good at remembering facts, figures and words, but sometimes using those facts and figures to create a new idea seemed to be lacking. Also for the students, the focus on education seemed to be stressful to many of them. After a full day of school, their mom would take them to piano, additional math lessons (Kumon), Tae Kwon Do and other lessons. The students seemed to be pushed into not being children. I found some who rejected it by just not caring if they learned or not and others who were very driven. As a teacher, it was easy to tell which ones were being pushed into it vs. which ones were happy to learn. Also, I remember reading in the news about students who would commit suicide because they failed or couldn’t get into the university of choice or the one that their father, brother or sister got into.

A proxy server is essentially a computer on the internet that has an IP address of its own. All requests to the Internet go to the proxy server first, which evaluates the request and forwards it to the Internet. Likewise, responses come back to the proxy server and then to the user.

For example, some patients require a dental crown for a tooth that has broken down, yet another might want to replace an existing metal or discoloured crown with a porcelain crown to match in with existing teeth following whitening.\\n Cosmetic dentistry is where the dentist is performing treatment to enhance a patient’s smile.\\n Dental Hygiene\\n Sometimes a trip to the dental hygienist can vastly improve a smile. Our hygienists also offer Airflow which is a treatment to remove heavy staining from teeth, almost like a gentle sandblasting.\\nTooth whitening\\n Whitening treatments have a huge impact on the way you look and can be done in house or at home, or a combination of both.\\nVeneers\\n These are wafer thin slivers of porcelain that are bonded to the front surface of teeth to improve the look of worn, broken, discoloured or gappy teeth. They are made at specialist laboratories to look indistinguishable from natural teeth. They aren’t always the best solution but in cases where they are, they achieve an excellent aesthetic result.\\n Crowns\\n Dental crowns can be made to replace broken down teeth. The materials are now so highly advanced that a completely natural look can be achieved in many cases, especially when used in conjunction with gum contouring.\\n Composite Bonding\\n This technique can be used to repair and/or enhance natural teeth. The materials are excellent so the result looks completely natural. This treatment has the advantage of being minimally invasive and is often a good alternative to veneers.\\n Bridges\\n These can be used to replace missing teeth either with or without dental implants.\\n Dental Implants\\n These are used to replace missing teeth and essentially become a new tooth. They can look completely natural, can function like normal teeth and if looked after, can last as long as natural teeth. They also have the benefit of preserving facial bone which would otherwise be lost without a ‘root’ of a tooth, and this in turn helps to keep the years off your face!\\nOrthodontics\\n We offer invisible orthodontics and 6 Month Smiles. Sometimes orthodontics is used to move teeth into a position to maximise the aesthetic result of veneers, crowns or bridges.\\nGum Contouring\\n This is done to improve the health of your gums and the appearance of your smile.

Otherwise, we’ll have to have a [math]k[/math] such that [math]f(k) = n-1[/math] and [math]f(k+1) = n+1[/math], which means that [math]f(n-1) = 2k+1[/math], [math]f(n+1) = 2k+3[/math], and [math]f(n)[/math] is forced to be [math]2k+2[/math].\\n So let’s prove that\\n Claim: For every [math]k \\\\in \\\\N[/math], [math]f(k+1) - f(k) \\\\in \\\\{1,2\\\\}[/math]\\n Proof: We’ve already proved this for [math]k \\\\leq 9[/math]. Now assume this is true for all [math]k < m > 7[/math]. We want to prove that [math]f(m) - f(m-1) = 1[/math] or [math]2[/math].\\n Since [math]f(m-1) > m+1[/math] (given that [math]f(7) = 11 > 7+1[/math] and that [math]f[/math] is strictly increasing, which means that [math]f(n) - n[/math] is non-decreasing), and, by hypothesis, there is no gap bigger than 2 in the consecutive values of the function up to this point, that means that ther exists a [math]k < m[/math] such that either [math]f(k) = m[/math] or [math]f(k) = m-1[/math].\\n Suppose that both [math]m[/math] and [math]m-1[/math] are in the image of [math]f[/math]. Then necessarily (by monotonicity), we need to have [math]f(k) = m-1[/math], [math]f(k+1) = m[/math] for some [math]k[/math], which means that [math]f(m) - f(m-1) = 2k + 3 - (2k + 1) = 2[/math], and we’re done.\\n If [math]m[/math] isn’t on the image, by the induction hypothesis, we’ll have a [math]k<m[/math] such that [math]f(k) = m-1[/math] and [math]f(k+1) = m+1[/math], which means that [math]f(m-1) = 2k+1[/math], [math]f(m+1) = 2k+3[/math], hence [math]f(m) = 2k+2[/math] and [math]f(m) - f(m-1) = 1[/math], done.\\n The only case left is that [math]m[/math] is on the image of [math]f[/math], but [math]m-1[/math] is not. Then we have [math]f(k) = m-2[/math], [math]f(k+1) = m[/math], [math]f(m-2) = 2k+1[/math], [math]f(m) = 2k+3[/math], [math]f(m-1) = 2k+2[/math], and [math]f(m) - f(m-1) = 1[/math], Q.E.D.\\nPS: naively, one would expect [math]f(n)/n[/math] to converge to [math]\\\\sqrt{2}[/math], but it doesn’t seem to be true. Actually, [math]f(n)/n[/math] oscillates between 4/3 and 3/2. Here’s the plot of [math]f(n)/n[/math] for [math]n<10^7[/math]\\nThe distance between consecutive crests (or valleys) grows exponentially, with a factor of 2, since\\n [math]f(n) = 3/2 \\\\; n \\\\Rightarrow f(3/2 \\\\; n) = 2n + 1 = 4/3 \\\\; (3/2 \\\\; n) + 1\\\\Rightarrow f(2n+1) = 3n + 1 =  3/2 \\\\; (2n + 1) - 1/2[/math]\\nPPS: The simple pyhton script I used to calculate [math]f[/math] up to [math]10^7[/math]:\\nf = {1:2}\\xa0k=1\\xa0for i in range(2,10000000):\\xa0 while f[k] < i:\\xa0 \\tk = k+1\\xa0 if f[k] == i:\\xa0 \\tf[i] = 2*k+1\\xa0 if f[k] == i+1:\\xa0 \\tf[i] = 2*k\\xa0\\n'},\n",

Now, you're wondering what to invest in during 2022. Well, let me shed some light on this topic for you.\\n First and foremost, it's important to clarify that investing in cryptocurrency is legal. Over the years, governments and regulatory bodies have recognized its potential and implemented frameworks to ensure its legitimacy. However, as with any investment, it's crucial to exercise caution and conduct thorough research before diving in.\\n Now, let's talk about the potential profitability of investing in cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrencies have proven to be a lucrative investment avenue for many individuals. Bitcoin, the most well-known cryptocurrency, experienced significant price appreciation over the past decade, making early investors incredibly wealthy. This success story has inspired countless others to explore the world of digital currencies.\\n However, it's essential to remember that the cryptocurrency market is highly volatile. Prices can fluctuate wildly in short periods, which can lead to substantial gains or losses. To make informed investment decisions, consider the following factors:\\n 1. Research and Educate Yourself: Knowledge is power in the world of crypto. Take the time to understand blockchain technology, different cryptocurrencies, and their use cases. Stay up-to-date with industry news and developments.\\n 2. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Consider investing in a mix of established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, as well as promising altcoins with unique value propositions.\\n 3. Understand Risk Appetite: Determine your risk tolerance before investing in crypto. If you're comfortable with higher risks, you may consider investing in smaller cryptocurrencies with potential for significant returns. Conversely, if you prefer stability, focus on more established and widely adopted cryptocurrencies.\\n 4. Seek Professional Advice: Consult with financial advisors or cryptocurrency experts who can provide valuable insights and guidance tailored to your investment goals. They can help you navigate the complexities of the market and mitigate potential risks.\\n 5. Keep Security a Priority: Safeguard your investments by adopting best practices for storing and securing your digital assets. Utilize reliable cryptocurrency wallets, enable two-factor authentication, and beware of phishing attempts and scams.\\n 6. Stay Informed About Regulations: Governments worldwide are continuously updating regulations concerning cryptocurrencies. Stay informed about the legal landscape of your country to ensure compliance with relevant laws.\\n Remember, investing in cryptocurrency carries inherent risks, just like any other investment. It's crucial to approach it with a long-term perspective, realistic expectations, and a willingness to learn from both successes and setbacks.\\n Ultimately, whether you choose to invest in cryptocurrencies or not is a personal decision that should align with your financial goals and risk appetite. If you decide to venture into this exciting realm, do so responsibly, armed with knowledge and a solid investment strategy.\\n[LINKED_TEXT: Binance Crypto Pumps SignalsWe do massive pumps on Poloniex.com Kucoin.com Binance.com with 5x-300x profits.

              "  'answer': 'It happened to me. I’m staying anonymous for obvious reasons.\\n A few years back, part of my job required me to travel abroad. I spent 2-3 months home and abroad alternatively for about 2 years. I had a 2-year-old son and a side business which a few friends and I cofounded. I was busy with my day job so my wife helped run the store on my behalf so she spent a lot of time working at the store along with my friends\\n One day, I was abroad and got a phone call from my wife saying she was pregnant again. It was totally unexpected, but soon the happy feeling overcame the vague doubt that I had.\\n Fast forward a few years, I no longer had to travel for work and had 2 little boys that I love dearly. Everybody says my older son is a smaller version of me while the young one doesn\\'t look anything like me, not in the slightest. I never had any suspicion about our biological relationship until one day I found out a conversation between my wife and one of my friend (who was married and had a child. Let\\'s call him Ken) when I was away in which he confessed his affection for her. My wife denied any relationship between them and said that it was only Ken and that she did not reciprocate.\\n I was shocked and could not believe Ken could do that to me, but it was just the beginning. Since then I had had this uneasy feeling. Somehow I knew my wife wasn\\'t telling the truth, but I have no way to find out. As my younger boy growing up, he takes after Ken. I told myself I needed to settle this once and for all. I took DNA tests, twice. And as you can guess the two results confirmed that I was not the biological father.\\n I was lost. Not in my wildest dream can I imagine this would happen to me. I asked my wife to tell me the truth, and with the evidence at hand, she couldn\\'t deny it anymore and admitted to having an affair with my friend when I was gone. My world collapsed. I walked away broken. I wandered for a month here and there thinking about what I did wrong and for what purpose I was living.\\n After I regain my sanity. I called my friend in the calmest way I can to inform him he had a son that he didn\\'t know of and told him I was ready to give him back. Then I called my wife and said I wanted a divorce and everything had been arranged for that to happen the earliest possible. I want revenge. \"They have to pay for what they did to me.\" I thought. I fully provided for my wife financially, she had no job and wouldn\\'t be able to support the child alone. Ken, on the other hand, was a successful businessman but he had a family with two daughters and I was sure he wouldn\\'t have the courage to tell his wife about this, and I was right. For almost a year when we were in the middle of the divorce, he never once visited his son nor provided any support for him. I guess he was busy covering things up. I could have easily talked to his wife (we’re also friends) but I refrained. I did not want his innocent kids to be in the same situation as mine, at least not because of me.\\n So we agreed that my older son would stay with me and the younger one would live with his mother after the divorce. My older son is kind of smart. He can take care of himself. He learned the alphabet, colors, and shapes by himself by watching youtube videos when I was gone for business (English is not our mother tongue and we’re living in an English speaking country). The second one is not as smart. He\\'s soft and sentimental. So in a way I was really worried about him.\\n I thought I would feel better after I had my revenge. I did not. When my selfishness died down, I really missed my younger son and the time we were together. I missed the time when he kissed me goodbye before I left for work on the sidewalk every morning and immediately ran to the front window, placed a chair so he could look outside and waved at me as I drove off. If you have children you probably know how that feels.\\n As the divorce was closing (it was complicated because of the nature of our marriage), I dropped by one day to see him. His mother had to find a job, so she did not have the time to take good care of him as when they were living with me. He immediately dashed and hugged me as soon as I showed up at the doorstep. I got a look at him for a long time. He was having a skin disease due to the hygiene of the water where he was living and obviously was not in good shape. That hit me hard to look back and think how cute and healthy he used to be. When he asked \"Dad, when will you pick me up and return home?\", I was in tear before I knew it. I spent the night with him that day. In his dream, he was crying: \"I want my dad. Where\\'s my dad?\". Suddenly all the memories came back, that moment when I first hold him in my arms on his birthday, all the white nights feeding him and changing explosive diapers while humming songs that do not exist trying to get him to sleep, that moment when he made his first step, all the family outing days when we ran, laughed, kissed and sang… All of those made I realize what was important to me and how bad I was as a father. I had failed my sons miserably. I just need my children to be happy. It didn\\'t matter if he was my biological child or not. Our bond was real and strong. I love him, and he loves me. That\\'s all that matters. I grew up with the blessing and love of my parents. Why did I let my son suffer because of the mistake he didn\\'t make? I cried out loud like a child, it feels good to show your true feelings once in a while…\\n Fast forward a year, we\\'re now together again. I talked to Ken. We agreed the boy is MY son and he had to stay away from him for the rest of his life.\\n The boys are growing fast, happy, and loved. I\\'m glad I got them in my life. This fatherhood is something I wouldn\\'t trade the world for.\\n I love my sons and still learning to be a good father...\\n Update\\n Thank you all for reading the story of my life and for commenting. I would like to clarify a few things:\\nWhen I say my younger son was soft and sentimental, I did not mean in a negative way. Imagine you were a parent bear in the wild and you had two cubs. One was strong and smart, the other was not as so. Knowing surviving out there is hard and brutal, you’d probably worry about the latter more and probably would spend more time getting him prepared.As for Ken, I didn’t want to expose him because I couldn’t care less about him. What he was gonna do have nothing to do with me. He also has kids and I don’t want them to be without their parents because of his infidelity. Kids are innocent, I won’t repeat my mistake.\\nUpdate 2 (and final)\\nWow, the response to my story was overwhelming so I decided to give some updates:I guess this story is incomplete without talking about my wife. Because of the immigration status, a divorce means separation for all of us so we’re putting that off. My wife and I are staying in the same roof like roommates. I’m helping her get all the trainings necessary for a better job when the situation changes. We’re staying friends and I sincerely hope things turn out better for her. After all, she’s still the mother of my kids and no one is happy to see their mom struggle.For those who called me weak, sucker… I thank you for thinking for me and I appreciate it. I totally understand your rationales. Had this not happened to me, I would have never thought I could do this. But when it’s a reality, you have to deal and learn from it. I’m glad I learned how to forgive and experienced love. You know that cliché saying ”When life gives you lemons, make lemonade”? Well, maybe it’s not very cliché after all.\\n'},\n",

Due to their organic nature, they are very well suited for the people who are allergic to synthetic substances. The greatest advantage of such mattresses is that they are very well ventilated and thus provide enhanced hygroscopic properties, i.e., they impart great air circulation and moisture absorption characteristics.\\n Spring mattresses make use of either one of the [LINKED_TEXT: bonnell, offset, pocket-spring and continuous coils] [URL: https://shoppinaire.quora.com/The-extensive-guide-to-purchasing-a-new-Mattress] as the core/support material on top of which a comfort layer is attached. it is meant to provide adequate comfort and cushioning to the user’s body. When lying/sitting on a spring mattress, the body does not get sunken into the mattress like in case of foam mattress, but stays above it. This facilitates easier turning movements during sleep.\\nOn the other hand, foam based mattress makes use of either PU or Memory foam as the core/support layer, on top of which the comfort layer is built. Among the two, Memory foam provides better all-round comfort to the body as compared to a PU foam and is well suited for people who suffer from neck/spine issues or others who prefer body hugging comfort. In fact, due to their therapeutic properties, memory foam mattresses are commonly known by their secondary name - Orthopedic Mattresses.\\n While, mattresses built with PU foam provide better temperature regulation and the user sleeps cooler than in case of memory foam mattress. They also tend to be marginally more ‘bouncy’ than their memory foam counterparts. So, those who prefer less sunken sitting/lying experience would find PU foam mattresses a great choice. A great advantage of PU foam mattresses is that they are relatively light in weight as compared to the other two configurations.\\nIn addition to the insights shared above, factors such as the dimensions of the mattress one should opt for relative to the dimensions of the bed, and awareness about the ways by which some brands resort to cutting production costs by using low-grade materials in the fabrication of the mattresses, that cause several neck and spine issues, too play crucial roles in determining the product one should opt for.

It is a metabolic disorder that occurs when the body is unable to produce or effectively use insulin, which leads to high blood sugar levels. While there are several conventional treatments available, many people turn to Ayurvedic medicine for a more holistic approach to managing their diabetes.\\n Ayurveda is a traditional system of medicine that originated in India over 5,000 years ago. It is based on the belief that health and wellness depend on a delicate balance between the mind, body, and spirit. Ayurvedic practitioners use a combination of herbal remedies, dietary changes, and lifestyle modifications to address the root cause of health problems and restore balance to the body.\\n One of the most popular Ayurvedic medicines for diabetes is called “Maha Sudarshan Churna”. It is a combination of various herbs such as guduchi, ginger, cinnamon, and turmeric. These herbs are known to have antidiabetic properties and can help regulate blood sugar levels, improve insulin sensitivity, and reduce inflammation in the body.\\n Guduchi, also known as Tinospora cordifolia, is a powerful immune booster that has been shown to reduce blood sugar levels in people with type 2 diabetes. Ginger, another common ingredient in Ayurvedic medicines, can help improve insulin sensitivity and lower fasting blood sugar levels. Cinnamon is known to enhance insulin sensitivity and improve glucose metabolism. Turmeric, which contains the active compound curcumin, has anti-inflammatory properties and can help protect against complications associated with diabetes.\\n While Ayurvedic medicines can be beneficial for people with diabetes, it is important to note that they should always be taken under the supervision of a trained practitioner and should not replace conventional medical treatments. It is also essential to make lifestyle modifications such as eating a healthy diet, getting regular exercise, managing stress, and maintaining a healthy weight to effectively manage diabetes.\\n In conclusion, Maha Sudarshan Churna is a popular Ayurvedic medicine for diabetes that contains a combination of herbs with antidiabetic properties. While Ayurvedic medicines can be helpful in managing diabetes, it is important to consult with a trained practitioner and follow conventional medical treatments to effectively manage the condition. Making lifestyle modifications such as healthy eating and regular exercise is also essential in managing diabetes and maintaining overall health and wellness.\\n ALSO READ: [LINKED_TEXT: How Diabetes kills!] [URL: https://sites.google.com/view/healthyglucose/home]\\n'},\n",

This awareness allows the dreamer to have a certain level of control and volition within the dream environment.During a lucid dream, the dreamer may be able to consciously manipulate or direct the events, characters, and surroundings within the dream. They can choose to fly, explore different landscapes, interact with dream characters, and even alter the dream\\'s storyline. Lucid dreaming can be a vivid and immersive experience, where the dreamer can actively engage and participate in the dream world.From a spiritual perspective, some people believe that lucid dreaming can offer a deeper understanding of oneself, provide opportunities for personal growth and exploration, and even serve as a gateway to spiritual realms. It is thought that lucid dreaming allows individuals to access higher levels of consciousness and tap into their inner wisdom.\\nAstral projection (also known as astral travel) is a term used in esotericism to describe an intentional out-of-body experience (OBE) that assumes the existence of a subtle body called an \"astral body\" or \"body of light\" through which consciousness can function separately from the physical body and travel throughout the astral plane. The idea of astral travel is ancient and occurs in multiple cultures. The modern terminology of of \"astral projection\" was coined and promoted by 19th-century Theosophists .\\n'},\n",

              "  'answer': \"This Answer was originally a Comment, but I realised it outgrew itself…\\n There seems to be an incredulous tone to many ‘is it true that’ Questions about healthcare in the UK, most with a strong implication it can't be possible because whoever asked lives somewhere every attempt to make affordable public heathcare work has been actively sabotaged.\\n This probably won't make any impression on those who prefer a fantasy version where it costs millions to get treatment that, in fact - because it's not run like a protection racket - at most costs a few thousands - but like a few million other people over sixty, I had a ‘free’ colonoscopy and - having ticked the ‘just take care of it’ box - some precancerous polyps were excised.\\n That exercise was repeated for a few years, with excellent results, all at no direct cost to me (as a retiree I no longer contribute to the NI scheme though I did so throughout my working life).\\n Now I take tests, it takes no effort, the cost to the country is low, far, far lower than treating cancer.\\n This means public health money is spent more wisely, instead of piling on bills in order to get money from HMOs who pad bills and do anything to avoid paying out - all in the pursuit of profits - so here we have many proactive health initiatives and onging programmes - like free ‘flu shots for the last half century - that scale back the problems.\\n Having parents who were both cancer victims, diagnosed too late to do much about it, and a number of relatives who gave also passed in that way, I'm glad I didn't have to sell my house to buy a fraction of the level of care I received - care that wouldn't be part of any ‘affordable’ health insurance scheme of the sort that are considered universal - but that leave huge numbers (more people than live in the UK) entirely without any kind of healthcare in the USA, only because of the way billions of dollars are not used to treat people, but generate profit, treating them as a cash cow at every turn.\\n When I realised a slight hearing loss in one ear worsened dramatically, I booked a hearing test at the local hospotal. That took only a couple of weeks, the hearing loss was confirmed, and I was given a cranial MRI scan only a half hour later, free of charge and without an apointment.\\n It was clear, and after a fortnight I got a hearing aid - also free at the point of delivery - and the right to receive free batteries for life…\\n But try telling that to a person who thinks an MRI scan is unaffordable for technical reasons, rather than the massive added cost of investors, lawyers, accountants, political lobbyists, and the sort of reactionary nut-jobs who make outrageously politicised claims.\\n A common theme is that the only way a socialist country (meaning Stalin-era Communist Russia) can make the numbers work is to treat the Politburo - which we don't have - lavishly, while everyone else is euthanised if they so much as get a hangnail.\\n This is not only laughably innaccurate, it is close to the way American healthcare actually works, where an ability to pay out of pocket bills in the millions gets the wealthy made well, while those who have to rely on health insurance are made paupers, or are condemned to die.\\n As to the last part of the Question, about refusing to run endless tests, the NHS also has mental health responsibities.\\n One of them is to ensure hypochondriacs don't deny people with physical illnesses treatment by monopolising all the available resources.\\n Regrettably, in the past, many general practitioners worked on a ‘gut instinct’ belief-system, instead of the more modern, effective and humane science-based precautionary principal.\\n PS\\n My mum had multiple conditions, all real, but intractable, she was shamefully neglected in her final years.\\n Obviously unwell, she was in and out of hospital for a decade until someone did some actual diagnostic tests but only a full decade too late for it to matter.\\n That's why I applaud the bowel cancer screening and the many other specialist proactive initiatives that - not being left to an series of overworked GPs who much preferred patients with clear-cut conditions, typically treatable with a short course of pills, and with nice tidy positive clinical outcomes - can actually catch serious illness while they are still treatable.\\n\"},\n",

That is why antislavery legislation is so important at every level of government, and why it should be written into trade treaties\\n Americans are the most resistant to one crucial realisation, and that is understanding the direction the anti slavery movement took after its initial successes. It looked more closely at economic, political and social power structures, and at the master-servant as well as the master-slave relationship.\\n In those years of the industrial revolution it saw the children working, often in pitch darkness in the mines. It saw them crippled in factories, women forced by economic circumstance to slave away in factories for long hours, even when heavily pregnant. It saw the evils of class structures in society, and drew the connection between a home police state and an overseas colony\\n Sometimes working people recognised it too - Lancashire cotton workers refused to handle cotton from slave states, despite loss of earnings to themselves\\n The antislavery movement led to Trade Unionism, and to concepts of social democracy and representative democracy.\\n Democracy never really evolved from a Greek ideal - It failed to do that in well over two thousand years. Democracy as we know, and strive for it, was the product of compassionate realisation that slavery was a sin against Humanity that degrades the overseer, far more than the slave, even in the eyes of whatever God. The American fear of “Socialism” is really the slave owners fear of emancipation - of loss of privilege, and the delusion of personal superiority\\n Slavery was not abolished in 1865 the process of dismantling it continues to this day….Think what you are voting for wherever you are and in whatever country…\\n'},\n",

This life is mercifully short and packed with experiences that will translate into the next life..or not, depending on what we do with them.the Bible says that God is not willing that any should perish but that all would come to repentance.The most wicked King of the kingdom of Judah was Manasseh. He reigned for 55 years, more than any other king and yet he shed innocent blood during most of his reign. His grandson, Josiah, only reigned 31 years, though he was one of the top 5 Kings of Judah, in righteousness comparable to King David.What was Josiah's sin that he be so punished? Only God knows the answer to this question, but I do find it interesting that Manasseh had a change of heart at the end of his life and enacted a series of reforms before he died.Had he been properly judged for all of his misdeeds, that moment of repentance would not have happened and he would have died in his sins.Why was John the Baptist beheaded, as well as James, but Peter was spared? I'm sure God had his purposes.The disciples once asked Jesus, who sinned, this blind man or his parents?

But unless you repent, you too will all perish\\n Absolutely yes. If you just need to feel better, get everything that might makes you more sad or depressed AWAY, and everyone who puts your issues on the spot as well! listening to sad music, talking to the wrong people about what makes you feel really sad, going to places that are related to bad memories, all of that can make your depression worse. Talk it out man! Write down everything. Whatever are your feelings ACCEPT them, see and understand what is their purpose and why do you feel this way! find a way out of it. Help yourself. Talk to new, fresh people. Go to new places. Try new clothes with new colours. Discover yourself again. Put your hand on heart, feel that heartbeat, and be grateful for it. Believe me if you give up to depression it will eat your soul. Whatever your age, you have a great life, you just can't see that well. And it's just a decision, remember that. You're the one who decides whether to be sad and let depression mess with you or to change something and get your life in a good, bright direction.What are you trying to clone.\\n Cloning a lot of plants is very easy, you can take a cutting, place it in some compost an the cutting will develop roots. you now have two genetically identical plants.With some plants like most berries or vines it is even easier, just peg a part of the plant onto the ground and it will develop roots. Once it is rooted you can simply cut the vine connecting the new plant to the old.With mammals things are more difficult, you need some basic lab equipment. Basically you have to remove the nucleus (all the genetic material) from an egg cell and replace it with a cell nucleus taken from the animal you wish to clone, fuse the two together with a electric shock and then implant the clone embryo into the womb of a female animal so that it can develop to maturity.If you are trying to clone a hard disk, use a linux boot disk and a program called gparted\\n\"},\n",

Focus should be there for allievate poverty and increasing employment opportunity. Right now India need to resort to basic roots of ancient economy. First thing is make sure everything is fair and square. For example now a days malls are popping up in every small town. It is very wonderful to malls to pop ups. But my issue is they undersale of price necessity items to destroy small shops in nearby. Malls can provide facilities or other amenities but underpricing essential good should be deemed as crime. Everytime a small shop go down it affect anyways more than 4 families. Monopolistic tendencies of economy will lead wide spread of poverty. W\\n Another step whichever industry is behind or lagging in country, government should give atmost relaxation of taxes and laws. For example nambiar started bpl in 1960 to India hoping India to have electronic industry revolution as par with Japan and China. In kerala with trade union issue it forced to move to bangalore. It is still going through crisis in spite the product of bpl was top notch at once\\nInspite blame should on management, government too is responsible for this fiasco. Whether India may surpress China in number, but technological industries we are miles behind not just Japan and China, but countries like philphines and Bangladesh rapidly growing. So self sufficiency in every industry should focus of government of India. Also small scale industry little more rigidity is needed especially rural areas, because extreme competition in small stores make none profitable venture for all of them.(kind of old license raja can be implemented here)\\n Also when economy is very bad state, then it stupid decision to increase tax. It will do more damage. Right thing to do is to decrease the tax. Reducing pension age to fifty is best thing to do, as after 50 productivity of old may be less and all it increase job opportunities of younger generation. All government enterprises which doesn't yield profit should be privatised iimmieditly\\n Another is majority appreasment syndrome in business should be stopped. For example\\n Private bus owners, theatre owners are becoming scapegoats because government want to appease the masses. So theatres and private owners are struggling in India. Their price determination should be loosen up.\\n For farmers price for yield should cost plus fair profit, format. Minimum price should be 3 times yield of cost of farming expense. For example if farmer put 100 rs for production of his yield, he should get rupees 300 in his hand when his product leave from his farm. If any power is playing to manipulate the price to substantially reduce or increase such power should be dealt with extreme brutality.\\n\"},\n",

              " {'question': 'Does the Bible mention anything about a place \"between\" heaven and hell?',\n",
              "  'answer': 'Yes, Earth.\\n Catholics will tell you that there is a purgatory. Purgatory is a place where you go to become purged from your sins, so that you can enter Heaven. But their location of Purgatory is wrong.\\n This Earth you are living on now is the real Purgatory. It is this life that is your proving ground before God. And so, you only have this life to purge yourself of your own sins. For the Bible states that once to death and then judgement.\\n We also know that this world is Purgatory, because there is a constant war between the human flesh and the human spirit. The human spirit wants to live a Godly life in Jesus, and the human flesh wants to be ultimately selfish.\\n The Bible contains several verses that discuss the testing and refining of believers. Here are a few key passages along with their interpretations:\\n1 Peter 1:6-7:\"In all this you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while you may have had to suffer grief in all kinds of trials. These have come so that the proven genuineness of your faith—of greater worth than gold, which perishes even though refined by fire—may result in praise, glory, and honor when Jesus Christ is revealed.\" Interpretation: Believers are encouraged to rejoice in the midst of trials, as these trials serve a purpose. Through the testing of their faith, they can develop genuine and steadfast faith, which is more valuable than perishable gold. This refined faith will bring praise, glory, and honor to Jesus Christ when He is revealed.James 1:2-4:\"Consider it pure joy, my brothers and sisters, whenever you face trials of many kinds because you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance. Let perseverance finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything.\" Interpretation: James instructs believers to view trials as opportunities for pure joy, recognizing that such testing of their faith leads to the development of perseverance. Through the process of enduring trials, believers can grow in maturity and become complete in their faith, lacking nothing that God desires for them.Psalm 66:10:\"For you, God, tested us; you refined us like silver.\" Interpretation: The psalmist acknowledges that God tests and refines His people, comparing it to the process of refining silver. Just as silver is purified through refining, God tests and purifies the hearts and lives of His people. This refining process shapes believers, removing impurities and bringing forth their true character.Proverbs 17:3:\"The crucible for silver and the furnace for gold, but the Lord tests the heart.\" Interpretation: This verse uses the imagery of refining silver and gold to illustrate how the Lord tests the hearts of people. Just as a crucible and a furnace are used to purify precious metals, God tests and examines the hearts of believers. Through these tests, God refines their hearts, purging impurities and revealing their true character.\\nThese verses emphasize the significance of trials and testing in the lives of believers. Through these refining processes, believers can develop genuine faith, perseverance, maturity, and a heart that is pleasing to God.\\n'},\n",

He was rude to her.] [URL: https://www.quora.com/Why-does-everyone-hate-Captain-Marvel-for-squeezing-that-guy-s-hand-He-was-rude-to-her/answer/Vincent-Baldy]\\n But I say this is utter bullshit, and here’s why:\\n The case for Nat:\\n She got slightly caught off guard when Happy tried to teach her about “Rule #1: Never take your eyes off your opponent”.\\nHer instincts kicked in, and she took Happy down. It was not a case of merely beating up a weaker opponent “because she could” or anything like that. Most of her missions involve gut-wrenching battles to the death. Everything she does is on a razor’s edge; the slightest mistake or miscalculation could mean the end of her.\\nSo if she’s in a boxing ring and sees a cheap shot headed her way that she wasn’t prepared for, can you honestly say that her actions were out of character, or even unwarranted to begin with?\\n She was literally in a boxing ring, being taught about boxing by a guy who underestimated her, and who then forced her unconscious training and muscle memory to kick in. Nobody’s gonna scream “sexism” in such a situation.\\n It also shows the audience one of her signature moves (the “wrap legs around head and do a spinny flippy thingie”), as it comes back again later on in the film:\\nThere’s nothing mean-spirited about it, it shows the audience some of the things they can expect to see from the character, and there’s no overtly obvious “girl power” bullshit involved. It’s just a good character building moment all around.\\n The case against Captain Marvel:\\nA biker in a poor part of town sees a young woman reading a map and offers her a ride while also doing what he thinks is a good attempt at flirting.\\n He is rather annoying, and of course physically imposing, but otherwise has no importance to the story, and no connection to any of the characters beyond this one scene.\\n A better way to go about it would be to simply have her say something like “No thanks, I think I’ve got the hang of this map now”, and then fly away. She’s powerful, he’s humbled, and all without anyone getting hurt or dealing with irreparable, lifelong mental, emotional, and physical trauma.\\n Hell, he could have been a redeemable character that shows up in multiple films.\\n Thanos: “And who are you?”\\n “They call me……The Don.” (pulls out shotgun. Thanos begins to laugh)\\n “And just what do you hope to accomplish with that child’s toy, little one?”\\n (Don pulls the trigger, just as Captain Marvel blasts Thanos in the chest., The Don thinks the shotgun did all the work.)\\n The Don: “American-made 12 gauge, you alien bastard!”\\n But instead, she gives her same arrogant smirk as she simultaneously crushes and burns the man’s hand in broad daylight, robs him of his transportation, steals clothes from another store, endangers other drivers on the road, and all this after giving a line about “smiling” like some sort of karmic “burn”.\\n And this after she herself literally invited the man in for a handshake, all for the sole purpose of torturing, robbing, and taunting him to his face.\\n This isn’t some sparring match that went a little too far, this is terrorizing the local populace with your powers and then robbing them of their possessions, and then further endangering lives elsewhere just because you can and there’s no one who can stop you.\\n You absolutely CANNOT compare these two scenes and act like Black Widow gets a pass and Captain Marvel doesn’t, and all because people are “overreacting”, apparently.\\n The only way you could say these scenes were the same would be if Natasha got out of the ring after beating Happy, slapped Pepper around, kicked Tony in the dick, stole his armor, and then flew through several buildings on her way out, narrowly missing a chopper or two.\\n Captain Marvel’s behavior is not only very overtly and obviously a “girl power” scene, but is done in such a horrendously mean-spirited and psychotic fashion as well. In every way that matters, the scene is like a perfect microcosm of not only everything people find wrong with the film and the character as a whole, but also a perfect example of the kind of crappy character building, weak and/or mean-spirited story telling, and undisguised political undertones that Marvel fans fear will permeate the MCU from now on.\\n And then if you don’t like it you’re “overreacting”.\\n\"},\n",

              "  'answer': \"One of the shrewdest and smartest business maneuvers that I've seen was when Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos acquired Whole Foods in 2017 for $13.7 billion.\\n At the time, Amazon was already a dominant force in the e-commerce space, but the company had been struggling to break into the grocery market. By acquiring Whole Foods, Amazon was able to gain a foothold in the grocery industry, which is one of the largest retail markets in the world.\\n The acquisition also gave Amazon access to Whole Foods' loyal customer base, which was made up of health-conscious, affluent shoppers. This allowed Amazon to expand its reach into a new demographic and attract new customers to its platform.\\n Additionally, the acquisition allowed Amazon to leverage Whole Foods' physical stores as distribution centers for its online orders. This helped Amazon to improve its delivery times and reduce its shipping costs.\\n Overall, the acquisition of Whole Foods was a shrewd and smart move by Jeff Bezos and Amazon. It allowed the company to expand its reach into a new market, gain access to a new customer base, and leverage the physical infrastructure of Whole Foods to improve its online operations.\\n\"},\n",

              "  'answer': 'THE SUBSTITUTION:Krul comes on for Cillessen in the 121st minute much to the latter\\'s surprise. So why does van Gaal do this? \\n \\nTHE DECISIONPlanned in advance:This was not a decision that Louis van Gaal took in the last minute. It was something that was well planned out from before. Tim Krul was prepped by the goal keeping coach and was told that if the situation arose, he would have to take the place between the posts during the shootout. van Gaal hid this plan from Cillessen so that it would not damage his confidence or affect his game. \\n CILLESSEN\\nCillessen was clearly unhappy about being substituted. He probably felt he wasn\\'t believed in or was not a big fan of the fact that he wasn\\'t informed in advance.\\n \\n\\nHowever, he was seen passionately celebrating each Dutch penalty and also the saves that Krul made. He hopefully understood the genius behind the change. van Gaal made it a point to dispel any rumors of a change in the number one keeper for the rest of the tournament, claiming Cillessen remains his number one choice.\\n THE ADVANTAGESRendered any prior Costa Rican preparation uselessIf the Costa Ricans had prepared for penalties, they would have studied Cillessen and his motions. However, in walked this other guy whom they did not research at all.\\n He\\'s very confident and is mouthing taunts at them. They have no idea who he is nor have they studied his motions. Also, it may have helped that Costa Rica had its previous game go to penalties. He probably observed how they approached that shootout.\\n \\n\\n Surprise, bit**!When you are so surprised at such a critical stage of an important match, you feel outwitted. It\\'s like preparing all night for one proof of a theorem or a topic for an examination because you are a 100% sure that it will be asked and then you find a 100 mark question on something you didn\\'t study for at all. Even though you may still get it, your confidence is not high at all.\\n \\nDeceptionKrul is not a specialist at saving penalties. A record of 2 saves out of 20 is not the sign of a penalty specialist. But did the Costa Ricans know that?  He sure looks like a penalty expert for all they know. Why would van Gaal bring him on otherwise? Clearly, a psychological decision and not a tactical one.\\n \\n\\n Pressure and attention off his playersThis was THE MOST IMPORTANT reason as far as I\\'m concerned. As soon as van Gaal made the change, all the attention deflected from the kick takers to the decision he made. If Netherlands, who have a horrible record at penalty shootouts, had indeed lost, he would have been blamed for a ludicrous decision. No one expected anything from Tim Krul either. Thus, it was a sacrificial move, showing that he was ready to take the heat in case something went wrong.\\n Penalty shootouts are won and lost very easily. It\\'s about handling your nerves well. When the pressure was off the Dutch kick takers, their experience came to the fore. He sent his four most experienced kick takers (with Huntelaar probably in line to take the fifth) to ensure nervousness would play no role in the result of a spot kick.\\n \\n\\n And then, something amazing happened.\\n Four perfect penalties.\\n Even the goalkeeper, Keylor Navas, who had such an amazing tournament and game and should have been coming into the shootout with great confidence, would have been slightly shaken by the sudden presence of the chatty Krul.\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nThe Dutch keeper dives the right way each time (5 out 5, saving two of them) after taunting the opposing kick takers into making mistakes. (His first save wasn\\'t really extraordinary or anything.) This is probably the result of his studies of the kick takers from the previous shootout that Costa Rica took part in. The players may have had conflicts about whether they should stick to what worked for them last time or if they should do something fancy to beat this \"penalty expert,\" whose job was just to apparently find out which way they were going to go.\\n \\n\\n\\n \\nNetherlands in the last four.\\n \\n'},\n",

Assumption: Nuclear weapons would not be used.\\n Short answer: No\\n Already many have explained in their answers. Just because 2 or more countries join in a war, they are not assured of a victory. Because wars are won based on the objectives set, the way it is executed and the total resources used.\\n I'm not sure how or what objectives are set by India and China - just to defeat USA? Defeat it, why? There has to be a strong purpose. We don't wage a war against a country for no reason, not for fun. There is no fun in a war. \\n End result of a war is dependent on how it is executed. How will India and China coordinate among themselves. Will the two countries invade USA in their land? From where will each attack? Or will they defend an attack from USA in Asia? The latter is not desirable for India and China as huge size of their populations will be killed. The former is extremely difficult to accomplish. \\n Resources for war: Others have detailed how USA is far more equipped in terms of weapons and war equipments to fight than many countries including China and India. And you mention in 2015 or 2016. Both of us combined are nowhere near USA in military resources. We only have far too many soldiers and USA can fight it in a manner convert the numbers to our disadvantage in the war. USA cannot defeat China and India and occupy the countries. But USA can inflict a huge damage on us.\\n Let me end it with an example. Israel fought its wars against a coalition of Arab countries and defeated them all (Ex. Wars of 1967, 1973).

It is common for dictionaries to use a star system to indicate word usage. Most words can be classified as general usage and do not need to be commented on. The problem is that the words can have different uses, some general and some slang. If it's slang you need to be aware  of it as it can be vulgar. For example if the word has one star it can be used in most informal situations by educated speakers. If the word has two stars it is used by most educated speakers but not in all situations. Care needs to be taken so as not to offend even though the word may be fine between friends. If it has three stars it is very vulgar and should be avoided by speakers of English as a foreign language. Also learn the symbols for literary words which are often found in literature but which are rarely used in spoken form. Finally  you have archaic and old-fashioned words that you may find in print, usually for humor but which you rarely hear in daily conversation.Another thing to note are the words used in dialects and in smaller regions.

Some people do report experiencing headaches after using over-ear noise-canceling headphones, but it's important to note that these are not inherently headache-inducing for everyone.\\n The cause of these headaches can vary between individuals and depend on several factors, including:\\nPressure Sensation: Over-ear noise-canceling headphones, particularly those with active noise cancellation (ANC), work by creating a kind of 'sound vacuum' which can sometimes give a sensation of pressure, similar to being in a fast-elevating elevator or airplane. Some people may be more sensitive to this sensation, which can potentially lead to discomfort or headaches.Improper Fit: If your headphones are too tight or not correctly adjusted, they can put excessive pressure on your ears and the sides of your head, which can cause headaches after prolonged use. Always make sure your headphones fit comfortably!Prolonged Use: Using any headphones, not just over-ear noise-canceling headphones, for extended periods can lead to fatigue and strain, which might result in a headache. It's always a good idea to take regular breaks to rest your ears.Volume Levels: Listening to audio at high volumes can not only be damaging to your hearing but can also cause headaches. The beauty of over-ear noise-canceling headphones is that you can listen to your content at lower volumes, thanks to the reduced background noise.\\nIf you're experiencing headaches after using over-ear noise-canceling headphones, it might be worth trying different brands or models, adjusting the fit, or taking more frequent breaks during use. If discomfort continues, you may want to consult a medical professional to ensure there isn't an underlying issue causing the headaches.\\n Remember, everyone's experiences with headphones can be unique, and what might cause discomfort for one person might not for another.\\n Hope this helps!

              "  'answer': 'Let\\'s read what man page says about scanf.\\nint scanf(const char *format, ...);\\n scanf reads input for numbers and other data types from standard input.\\n RETURN VALUE\\n On success, these functions return the number of input items successfully matched and assigned; this can be fewer than provided for, or even zero, in the event of an early matching failure.\\n The value EOF is returned if the end of input is reached before either the first successful conversion or a matching failure occurs. EOF is also returned if a read error occurs. \\nIn your case, the statement “scanf (\"%d\", a)” is wrong and will result in undefined behavior mostly “segmentation fault”. As you have missed ampersand “&” before variable a and b. So correct statement would be like below\\nint a,b;  \\xa0if (scanf (\"%d\",&a) == scanf (\"%d\",&b)) \\xa0{} \\xa0\\nscanf returns the number of input items successfully matched and assigned. here in the above case, scanf may return 0 or 1 depending on what inputs are given to the variables.\\n Just take below examples to understand.\\n int ret = scanf(“%d %d”, &a, &b);\\nIt will return 2 if both the inputs are integers. Here, successfully matching and assigned values are applicable for both the variables so the return value is 2.It will return 1 if the first input is an integer but the second one is not an integer. “%d” expects integer value. Here, successfully matching and assigned value is only applied to the first variable so the return value is 1.It will return 0 if both the inputs are not the integer value. Here, successfully matching and assigned value is applied to none.It will return 0 if the first input is noninteger and the second one is an integer value. Since first input itself is wrong so it won\\'t go for reading another variable.\\nThe answer to your question, we can do the comparison as scanf returns some value. In the end, we gonna compare the values.\\n But what will happen if you compare the function whose return type is void? I leave it to you guys to figure it out.\\n'},\n",

              "  'answer': '“GOLD! GOLD! I FOUND GOLD!” shouted Francisco Lopez, a native Californian in early 1842. Francisco couldn\\'t believe his luck. He wanted more!\\n He looked around the river.\\n “Wow! More gold!”\\n He moved some rocks and found even more. “There’s gold everywhere!” he jumped up and down with excitement. He became a millionaire in a few weeks.\\n Francisco is recognized as one of the first people to find gold in Northern California.\\n The word spread slowly at first. Then, a few years later, a San Francisco newspaper confirmed the opportunity and the word spread like wildfire.\\n By 1849, the news had spread around the world. An overwhelming number of gold-seekers began to arrive from every continent.\\n The famous name \"forty-niners\" originated from the approximately 90,000 people who arrived in California during this year, 1849.\\nOnce the news spread, everything happened very quickly. There was no easy way to get to California. Forty-niners faced hardship and often death on their way to get there. Almost overnight, opportunities became abundant everywhere.\\n —\\n Now, to answer your question, what are the differences between those who succeed slowly and those who succeed fast?\\n During the California Gold Rush, there were two types of people:\\n Those who wanted to get rich quick and those who were in for the long run.\\n Those who wanted to strike it rich quickly, were searching for a shortcut. They lacked patience, were highly emotional dreamers who lacked discipline.\\n These people were basically gambling with their lives. Hoping and wishing for the good luck to strike it rich in a few days.\\n On the other hand, those who wanted to get rich slowly were completely opposed to the shortcut seekers. They knew what they wanted. They were searching for long-term opportunities, not after an emotional dream.\\n These men were smart. They were NOT distracted, going after the “gold-gamble,” they were entrepreneurs who were there to make a huge business out of the gold that everyone else was after.\\n These entrepreneurs got into shipping to transport people and supply goods for the growing population. They built hotels, restaurants, sold the tools needed for miners.\\n Hundreds of ships were abandoned after their crews deserted them right after they got to land. Gold diggers would run as fast as possible to the goldfields to start searching for the precious metal.\\n Meanwhile, entrepreneurs were known to convert these boats into warehouses, stores, taverns, hotels, and even into jails.\\n Opportunities were massive. While the “get rich quick” gold diggers were risking their lives in the mountains, the unending demand of needs raised the prices of all the goods to unimaginable levels.\\n There are reports of bakeries charging one dollar for a slice of bread, two dollars if it was buttered, the equivalent of about $56 in today’s money.\\n A dozen eggs might cost you $90 at today’s prices. A pick axe would cost the equivalent of $1,500! Coffee $1,200 a pound and a pair of boots up to $3,000!\\n Two famous examples of slow-growth entrepreneurs who bloomed in this era are:\\n - Levi Strauss, founder of the American clothing company who supplied jeans to the miners.\\n Think about this, where are all the gold diggers? GONE!\\n Where is Levi Strauss & Co. 165 years later? Correct!\\n - Henry Wells and William Fargo started a transportation business in 1852. Later, they found the opportunity to get into financial services. In 1954, Wells Fargo & Union Trust shortened its name to Wells Fargo Bank.\\n Tell me, where are the gold diggers today? Don\\'t get distracted by gold’s glitter!\\n Slow, smart, hard work is by far the best way to succeed!\\n'},\n",

These all sometimes show up later in life but sometimes even young people can have these problems. They are not fun.\\n The lack of physical activity can take a toll on one’s happiness, when you can’t go hiking with your kids, for example, or skiing, or just about any kind of outdoor activity.\\n It’s tough. And yet, it is so very hard to overcome the desire to eat, and to face what seems like an unendurable and impossible lengthy period of deprivation to lose weight when you have a hundred pounds to lose.

But we are a nation of the economically ignorant. We’ve been falling for this fraud for almost 40 years now.\\n Economics is not rocket science. The only reason it seems that way to many of us, is because the “explanations” required to get us to accept the tax cut fraud, must be so complex, that they replace basic common sense with either a “belief” in some fairy tale nonsense, or so much confusion that the public can’t grasp the problem sufficiently to do anything about it.\\n The process is simple.\\n Tax cuts result in LESS TAX REVENUE!!!!! When the government doesn’t collect enough in taxes to pay for its obligations, this creates A DEFICIT. When the fiscally “responsible” Republicans then refuse to reverse the tax cut to address the deficit the tax cut created, the money is borrowed which INCREASES THE NATIONAL DEBT.\\n In other words, the “fiscally responsible” Republicans borrow money from the Working Class, to pay for the tax cuts for the rich and the corporations. Then the rich and the corporations lend us, the Working Class, the money they just got in tax cuts, to pay for the deficit created by the tax cuts!!!\\n The swindle is astonishingly easy to see.

Quite few issues moved along to abetter status once these dictators were ousted but the negative issues imported had been much uglier and far more than those, both horizontally and vertically ( quantity and quality, respectively). Besides, and let me focus on my own case as an Iraqis fellow, a dictator like Saddam regarded Iraq as if his own property, this urged him to build Iraq thinking that the credit would always be his, the stooges that succeeded him are a bunch of dual citizenship and Iranian homage agents whose only target had always been to rob Iraq of any resources. They spread sectarian killing while Saddam cared to curb any sectarian affiliation, no Sunni no Shiite, he wanted Iraqis to be Ba’thists, partisans like his own case but he never encouraged Iraqis to kill each other. Also, not one single neighboring country ever thought of offending Iraq, not Iran, not Kuwait, not Syria. Once Saddam and his regime (and party) were ousted, all of these countries played a vicious role destroying Iraq. Even Alqaeda and ISIS, they could never have been there while that regime was strong.

The two teams that picked ahead of the Bulls were teams that needed centers, so that’s why he didn’t get picked #1. Dean Smith’s UNC Tar Heels played team basketball and that limited Jordan offensively. Smith admitted he didn’t unleash MJ offensively (17 points a game for his three years at North Carolina), but he said that he didn’t limit him defensively. I could see in his third and last year at UNC that the NBA game was going to be where he shined the brightest and he did. In his second season, he broke his foot and was out 64 games. I can’t put my finger on it, but when he came back from that injury is when he took off like a shot out of a canyon.\\n There was this one college football punter back in the 1970’s who broke his leg or foot when he was just an average punter. After he was healed from his injury, he shot out of a cannon and was one of the best punters of the decade. He was booming long punts and became his team’s long field goal specialist, trying FG’s up to 60 yards when the team desperately needed points late in the first half or at the end of the game.\\n Jordan would’ve been great regardless, but him healing from a broken foot and him fighting with management to get back on the floor (and squabbling with mgt. seemingly all the time), might’ve made him physically and mentally stronger and more motivated to become one of the best players of all-time.\\n'},\n",

Someone in the triangle has to be the one to let go.\\n ‘Do You Like Brahms?’ is written using one of the great historic Musical love triangles as a pattern. Brahms was a musical student under the great German composer Robert Schumann. Brahms fell in love with Schumann’s wife Clara. But did not act on it, seemingly until after the death of Schumann. Interestingly, when finally freed to explore a relationship with Clara, Brahms withdrew.\\n In ‘Do You Like Brahms’, there are three Brahms Love Triangles. Each has to be worked out to a conclusion. Unlike in the real event with Brahms, the writer wanted a conclusion to the love affair.\\n Love Triangle # 1\\nThis is the main love triangle between a gifted Pianist, Park Joon-young, his best friend (Cellist Han Hyun-ho) and Han Hyun-ho’s girlfriend, Violinist Lee Jung-kyung. The gifted pianist Park Joon-young strongly loved Violinist Lee Jung-kyung, but never acted on it because of his friendship with Cellist Han Hyun-ho. In the end, the girlfriend fell in love with Park Joon-young, but his loyalty to his friend made him decide to break free from this love triangle. He withdrew.\\n Love Triangle # 2\\nBusiness Major Chae Song-ah made a life direction change late in life. At the age of 29, she decided to pursue Music as a career. The one who got her started and acted as her teacher was Yoon Dong-yoon, a gifted violinist, who lost his love of playing the Violin. Chae Song-ah developed a love for Yoon Dong-yoon, but did not act upon this emotion, because her best friend (Kang Min-sung) was madly in love with Yoon Dong-yoon. Yoon Dong-yoon comes to love Chae Song-ah, however, she withdraws from this triangle.\\n Love Triangle # 3\\nHaving both broken free from dead-end love triangles, Violinist Chae Song-ah and the gifted Pianist Park Joon-young connect. Through a slow build of trust, the two fall in love. However, ever lingering in the background are those from both Triangles who are hotly pursuing their lost loves. This virtually makes the Love Triangle a Love Quadrangle. Lee Jung-kyung heavily pursues Park Joon-young and Yoon Dong-yoon heavily pursues Chae Song-ah.\\n ‘Do You Like Brahms?’ The answer to that question from Park Joon-young was always no. The music (and maybe the history) of Brahms was a constant reminder of his love for Lee Jung-kyung, which took forever to shake. When Park Joon-young finally did break free, he could give his love to Chae Song-ah, who also finally breaks free of her Love Triangle. When these two finally got together and Park Joon-young expresses his love for Chae Song-ah, that scene is dramatic and cathartic. Breaking free of the Brahms Triangle, once again Park Joon-young could play Brahms again, as he expresses his love for Chae Song-ah through music written by Brahms.\\n ‘Do You Like Brahms?’ was written by Ryu Bo-ri\\n[LINKED_TEXT: Musical Love Triangle: Brahms & the Schumanns - Houston SymphonyThe Houston Symphony’s signature event of the 2019–20 season, Schumann Festival: Angels and Demons celebrates German composer Robert Schumann (1810–1856).

              "  'answer': 'The creature that resembles the hallucigenia in Attack on Titan is most likely the, literal, ‘Source of All Living Matter (or Source of All Life)’. This lifeform fused with a human to create the Power of Titans. Titans have been theorised to have the Sun’s light as an energy source since they become inactive after the Sun falls. This is indicative of a plant-based lifeform (e.g. tree), however, a Titan is also very mobile and can move swiftly, indicative of an animal-based lifeform.\\nNow, I should point out that the Titans’ energy source being the Sun’s light has several flaws, which is expected as it’s only a theory and not a proven fact. Firstly, there have been multiple instances of Titans maintaining activity in the night (as shown in Season 2, Season 3 and in Season 4). This was countered with the response that they are using the light reflected off of the moon. Again, this was a theory and not a proven fact. There are severe flaws with gaining energy from the light from the moon, but I’ll let those pass. The other point is that if Titans are like plants then the reaction that they use to intake sunlight does not provide them with energy.\\n A large misconception people have about plants is that photosynthesis provides them with energy, and the truth is that it does not. It produces glucose which plants then use in respiration in the night to gain energy. Yes, plants respire like humans and other animals. So if Titans were like plants, then they should be inactive during the day and active during the night since the light they intake does not release energy but should make glucose which is used in the night to release energy.\\nFor a person who has established their love for science, I am surprised Hange did not see the flaws in the theory that Titans gain energy from the Sun. I actually came up with a more plausible idea: Titans become inactive during the night to maintain their brain function like humans do. We sleep because if we don’t, our cognitive functions (senses and memory) will become impaired and unable to work. This makes sense because Titans also use their senses like we do; they use their eyes to see, ears to hear, etc (the organs aren’t just there for show).\\n As for the energy, it’s reasonable that the Titans’ energy originates from the Paths. Or Titans do use the Sun as an energy source, but sleep because they need to.\\n Going back to the Source of All Life, it provides the Eldian Race with a host of godlike abilities. Here is a hypothesis:\\nAfter Ymir’s passing, her three daughters inherited the Titan power. From observing the similarities between the Nine Titans (like the warhammer to the armoured, cart to the jaw, etc), people have grouped three Titan powers in each daughter. A theory I came up with is that each Titan represents a stage of a living being’s evolution.\\n Evolution is the process by which we evolve through the modification of our genes which leads to an enhancement in physical structure.\\nHow does this relate to the question? The hallucigenia-like being/the Source of All Living Matter may be an extremely evolved being that reached a higher dimension through long-lasting, extensive evolution. I’ll elaborate:\\n -The Monstrous Titan: Aggregate of the Jaw, Cart and Beast Titans. It has malformations and takes on animalistic characteristics. This is the earliest stage of evolution for life, with each being adapted to thrive in different environments. As a result, this Titan is the weakest of all Titans.\\n -The Moulding Titan: Aggregate of the Armoured, Colossal and Warhammer Titans. In contrast to the Monstrous Titan, this Titan represents the peak of evolution for physical/material/observable life (I’ll explain this observable and unobservable stuff later). It can change its own body composition, hinting at a superior lifeform because of its ability to modify its genes and body at will, rather than having to go through evolution to do so. This Titan represents the final stage of evolution for life forms that are exempt of the transcendence of conepts(e.g space and time). It can change its mass since it has Titans of varying masses (Colossal and Armoured/Warhammer). Most interestingly, it may be able to create entirely new forms of matter e.g. iceburst and glowing stone.\\n -The Principle Titan: Aggregate of the Attack, Female and Founding Titans. Most powerful Titan in existence, being able to tap into the original Founder Ymir’s power via the Paths. It can control time as well as conjure powers that transcend time and space. It represents the very last stage of evolution for life, where the being transcends abstract concepts like time, space, life and death. In fact, being able to exist beyond the three spatial dimensions(1D, 2D, 3D) and one temporal dimension (4D) gives the being the ability to hinder with and even ignore physics as shown when Titans are able to exert a massive force despite being so light and mostly devoid of mass without even having nearly enough acceleration to justify said force. Having ascended, the Titan has all the abilities of the Moulding Titan and more, such as: clairvoyance, precognition and control over time and space. It also can enter a plane in a higher dimension (Paths).\\nNow, the body composition and matter creation techniques are not possessed by the Colossal, Armoured or Warhammer Titans but this is only a theory. Apart from the Founder, no other a Titan has been said to have these abilities. However, the theory is still understandable since the Founding Titan has its own host of abilities separate to the ability to enter the Paths and command Ymir, which is when they have all Titan powers. These powers include: memory manipulation, clairvoyance and Titan control as when demonstrated, the user(s) did not need to go to the Paths.\\n The body manipulation is different; the Founder can’t do it unless they go to the Paths to control Ymir (the First Titan who has all Titan powers) which suggests that the biological manipulation may not be an ability the Founder independently possesses (/ can use without going to the Paths) which implies that it belongs to another Titan. It may be the case that after an Eldian gains all three Titans (Warhammer, Armoured and Colossal) it may gain the abilities to mould different forms of matter and change its biology.\\n The Power of Titans even being able to create iceburst is widely unknown to lots of fans, even though Zeke said that it was the King of Titans. This was again a part of what he heard, but, Rod Reiss supporting his statement by saying the glowing stones were made by the Power of Titans and the almost-magical properties of iceburst just scream Titan powers. Again these are said to the be the Founder’s powers, however, it just seems more realistic for the Moulding Titan being able to do this.\\n So that’s the hallucigenia, or Source of All Living Matter, and all it’s abilities in Attack on Titan.\\n Again, this is just a theory of an answer.\\nEdit: I just found out about Attack on Titan: Before the Fall. Its an official prequel to Attack on Titan and is considered canon. In the story, we are given insights on the creation of ODM gear which also includes the discovery of iceburst and ultra-hard steel. Iceburst was said to be deposited there by the First King, mirroring Zeke’s description of the origin of iceburst. Then there is ultra-hard steel, the steel was actually made from an iron bamboo shoot that absorbed metals from the Earth to make itself stronger. Presumably, the plant was also made by the Power of Titans and further supports the idea that the Power of Titans can create different forms of matter. Also, multiple Pure Titans were shown to have been moving during the night.\\n'},\n",

              " {'question': 'Why does Transcendental Meditation smell like a scam? Is this trademarked, paid program for real, or are they piggybacking on the general meditation trend?',\n",
              "  'answer': \"In 1973 (long before the current meditation trend existed) someone pointed out a picture of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi on a poster advertising a Transcendental Meditation lecture, and asked me what I thought of him.\\n I looked at that handsome Indian face with its radiant smile and guileless eyes and just thought no one could be that perfect. I waved my hand dismissively and snorted, “too good to be true.”\\n A year later, having forgotten this, I was introduced to TM by a different route (after yelling at them for charging money). By then I’d had a spiritual experience that had told me what to look for; TM met all the requirements, so I was a tiny bit more humble.\\n Now, 45 years later, I consider learning TM to have been the the single most valuable decision I made in life.\\n Because of TM I calculate I have lived at least twice as long as I would have without it; I’m many times over healthier, happier, wealthier, wiser and more spiritually awakened. Now I understand that what I saw in that first photo was a purity I’d come to believe didn’t exist. Like you, I’d seen that life was full of a lot of slick advertising schemes and everyone out for a buck, full of scams that I wasn't going to get caught up in.\\n But it wasn’t a scam. Maharishi’s Transcendental Meditation did everything the Intro lecture claimed it would, and much, much more—and now I understand why I was so suspicious. It is because TM and all of Maharishi’s 40 systems for perfect health are the most polished, most professional programs you’ll find anywhere. The TM organization is a very tight ship, run by a lot of dedicated teachers who are willing to submit to a lot of rules and regulations that Maharishi put in place in order to make sure that you and everyone else get exactly the right training in how to do this phenomenal meditation technique, to insure that you get exactly the right start to your journey to better health, wealth, and happiness.\\n Sometimes people are like I was—suspicious. They get a whiff of that polish and the only thing they can compare it to is a really slick scam because what is there in life that is as good, as real, as true, as solid as TM and other of Maharishi programs?\\n Here are some facts.\\nThe reason that TM is trademarked is NOT to grab money from its earnings but to preserve its purity and to protect you from those who claim to teach something “just as good.” Only the authentic Transcendental Meditation program can legally capitalize the name. This insures that the teachings you get from the TM people are the teachings Maharishi taught, and that it is the exactly the same technique that is so successful in scientific research.Charging money turned out to be another stroke of Maharishi’s genius. It funded people to teach TM, do research, pay for worldwide travel to promote it, pay for education programs to help people understand the value of meditation and living in accord with the laws of nature, pay for books and buildings for further education and research. Equally importantly, the charges were a means of keeping people meditating long enough to see the benefits, because you are more likely to value what has cost you something. But the charges aren’t for profit. The worldwide TM organization is an official non-profit educational program.Maharishi’s photos are everywhere on legitimate TM documents and websites not because it is a cult but because it is your guarantee that you are getting the authentic knowledge and authentic facts instead of some knock-off calling itself transcendental meditation.Transcendental Meditation comes with a money-back guarantee. It can offer this because TM works. Research shows that brain changes begin from the very first meditation. Over 600 research studies provide evidence that it works.In research studies that compare meditation techniques, TM is consistently in first place for effectiveness.Like other responders to this question have pointed out, after successfully overcoming religious fears that it might be some kind of Eastern mind-control cult, TM and its research proved the value of meditation. It was actually what awakened interest in meditation in the West. Other meditation techniques either came from traditions that almost no one had heard of up to that point, or were knock-offs. Also, TM isn’t mind-control. It is a fully natural, mechanical technique that is learned in a four-day, 1-to-1 1/2 hour-a-day course. Then, just like having learned where the light switch is, you own it.The Transcendental Meditation program has been taught around the world for more than 60 years in many reputable places, including schools, hospitals, and even in the military, where it is the most successful program for treating PTSD. In research conducted by the American Heart Association, it was found to be the only meditation technique that reduced blood pressure.\\nFor this and other reasons, you would be wise to trust that it isn’t a scam, but even so, read the research and ask good questions of TM teachers. (I am not a TM teacher and I get no money for writing about it. I write about it out of gratitude and compassion.) The final proof can only come from direct experience.\\n TM.org\\n\"},\n",

(Muscle mass is important for rugby as protection for joints and strength but it is not necessary to look like a body builder. Slightly different examples are weight lifters and Sumo wrestlers who need body mass rather than a sculpted physique.)\\n To return to the rugby player, he spent a lot of time in the gym working on weights but he spent even more time running and doing aerobic exercise. He ran at least 10 kilometres everyday, often twice that and did sprints. He could, and did, run marathons in around 2.5 hours. He was superbly fit aerobically but his body never had any spare energy to build muscle mass.\\n He also had no spare fat. I think his fat percentages were around 6%, which is too low. You actually need fat for a number of bodily functions and as a source of energy for aerobic exercise.\\n The other thing to note is that muscle bulk is achieved by hypertrophy of the muscles, increasing the size of the muscle cells. It may also entail a small layer of fat around the muscle particularly in the building muscle phase. If a lot of aerobic exercise is undertaken then hypertrophy is less likely to occur and fat percentages will be lower. Meaning muscles tend not to bulk as much as they would with less aerobic exercise.\\n I should note that, elite body builders working towards a competition aim to reduce fat to increase muscle definition and they get down to very low levels but in the muscle building phase they need more fat.\\n'},\n",

              "  'answer': 'In about 1985 the New York fire department got concerned about putting out fires in building like the twin towers that filled the skyline. They commissioned architects to model a skyscraper with a fire in the upper floors. No fire equipment was that tall and sprinkler systems couldn’t pump water that high fast enough to put the fire out so in 20 min the floors and furniture burn well enough to raise the temperature of the floor above to 2000f. The pre stress cables in the concrete floors expand and start to melt. When the upper floor falls it easily breaks the cables in the overheated floor below and no floor can support two falling floors much less all the floors above it. Their report made it clear that when a skyscraper gets a burning floor that you get all fire fighters out starting at 12 min. And spend all time getting people out of the building. At the time of the twin towers many years later not one of the recommendations from the report had been implemented. The plane crash behaved exactly as predicted in the report. 20 min after the crash the fire heated the ceiling floor to failure and we saw the wind push the walls outward as the stack of floors fall to the basement unimpeded by the floors below.\\n'},\n",

If they’d stayed together, and none of the members had passed on, it’s impossible to say what music they might have created. It’s hard to imagine they could have kept up the pace of their creative output throughout the 60s. By the end of the decade, it seemed evident that they were all ready to strike out on their own. So, even if the band would have remained a unit, John, Paul, and George probably would still have pursued solo projects, which would likely have diluted the band’s output. And, as the studio laboratory demands an enormous amount of time and concentrated energy, it seems unlikely that they would have been able to return to that ultimate level of collaboration as a band.\\n Led Zeppelin entered the scene just as The Beatles were beginning to burn out and fragment. They changed rock music forever by inventing an entirely new genre. Plant, Page, and Bonham have influenced nearly every rock singer, guitarist, and drummer that followed.\\n A band like Zep is much better suited than The Beatles to stadium concerts and festivals, which were becoming more prevalent at the dawn of the 70s. As was the new freeform, DJ programmed FM Radio.\\n Who knows which ensemble might have sustained more success or what the world might look like had they all kept the flame burning? Both bands were magical combinations of extraordinarily gifted, charismatic genius. It may seem obvious to say that the world is much better for the music of both bands.

              "  'answer': 'There are two things that a big exploration voyage like this would do, and that’s to leave genetic, and cultural, evidence of their passing. The Treasure Fleet was dazzlingly opulent and awesome, with ships that dwarfed those of the Europeans, and the fleet was crewed by thousands. Yet they left no cultural evidence in the legends of the tribes and nations on the coast of the Americas. No one tells the legend of the passing of the Great Fleet.\\n And sailors enjoy their nights out. Zheng He may have been a eunuch, but it’s doubtful that the several thousand men he had crewing his ships were. And yet there’s no genetic evidence in Native American blood.\\n Furthermore, there are no records of such a voyage in Chinese archives. Zheng He’s fleet sailed west, not east.\\n In my opinion, Menzies’ entire book is clickbait.\\n'},\n",

              "  'answer': \"Creating a good vector drawing requires attention to detail, precision, and creativity. Here are some tips to help you create high-quality vector artwork:\\n 1. Start with a Clear Idea: Have a clear concept or idea in mind before you begin. Planning your composition and design beforehand will help you stay focused and organized during the creation process.\\n 2. Use the Right Software: Choose a vector graphics editor like Adobe Illustrator or Inkscape, which provides powerful tools specifically designed for creating and editing vector artwork.\\n 3. Work with Layers: Organize your artwork using layers. This will allow you to work on different elements separately and make adjustments easily without affecting the rest of the design.\\n 4. Utilize Basic Shapes: Start with basic shapes like circles, squares, and rectangles to build the foundation of your artwork. Then, refine and transform these shapes to create more complex forms.\\n 5. Pay Attention to Proportions: Ensure that your artwork maintains proper proportions. Use grids or guidelines to align elements correctly.\\n 6. Be Mindful of Colors: Choose a cohesive color palette that complements your design. Consistent color usage can enhance the overall aesthetics of your vector drawing.\\n 7. Master Bezier Curves: Practice using Bezier curves to create smooth and precise lines. Understanding how to manipulate anchor points and handles will help you achieve clean and flowing shapes.\\n 8. Incorporate Layers of Detail: Add depth and interest to your artwork by incorporating layers of detail. This can be achieved through gradients, textures, or subtle shading.\\n 9. Experiment with Brushes and Effects: Experiment with various brush styles and effects to add texture and visual interest to your vector artwork.\\n 10. Save Iteratively: Save your work at different stages, using incremental file names. This will enable you to backtrack or revert to earlier versions if needed.\\n 11. Check for Scalability: Ensure that your vector artwork is scalable without losing quality. Vector graphics can be resized without any loss of resolution, making them suitable for various applications.\\n 12. Seek Inspiration: Look at other artists' vector work for inspiration and learn from their techniques. Analyze what makes their designs visually appealing and try to incorporate similar elements into your own creations.\\n Remember that creating impressive vector artwork takes practice and patience. Don't be afraid to experiment and refine your techniques. Over time, you'll develop your style and improve your skills as a vector artist.\\n\"},\n",

              "  'answer': \"The question of why prayers are sometimes seemingly unanswered is a complex and deeply personal one, and it's important to recognize that people have various beliefs and perspectives on this matter. Here are a few possible explanations that people may consider:\\nDivine Plan: Some religious traditions teach that God has a plan for every individual and that the answers to prayers may not always align with what we desire in the short term. It's possible that what we're asking for might not be in line with the greater plan that God has for us.Timing: People often pray for things they want or need in their lives, but the timing of when those things occur might not be immediate or even in the timeframe we expect. What we perceive as an unanswered prayer could be a matter of the right time not having arrived yet.Free Will: Many belief systems emphasize the importance of free will, meaning that God allows individuals to make their own choices and decisions. If what you're praying for involves the actions or choices of other people, God might not interfere with their free will to fulfill your request.Spiritual Growth: Some religious teachings suggest that challenges and difficulties can be opportunities for spiritual growth and development. What may seem like an unanswered prayer could be a way for you to learn and grow through adversity.Mystery of God: In many faiths, God's ways are often considered mysterious and beyond human comprehension. It's possible that there are reasons beyond our understanding for why prayers are not always answered in the way we hope.Faith and Trust: Maintaining faith and trust, even in the face of what appears to be unanswered prayers, can be a test of one's faith. It's possible that your faith is being tested or strengthened through the experience of waiting and uncertainty.Prayer Format: Some people believe that the manner in which prayers are made can influence their effectiveness. Focusing on gratitude, asking for guidance, or praying for the well-being of others are different approaches that might yield different results.Lack of Recognition: Sometimes, people attribute positive outcomes to their efforts or external circumstances rather than recognizing them as answers to prayers. It's possible that some prayers are answered in ways that are not immediately recognizable.Reflection and Introspection: The act of prayer can also be a way to reflect on our own desires, needs, and motivations. Sometimes, what we're asking for may not align with our deeper values or long-term well-being.\\nRemember that beliefs about prayer can vary widely based on individual spiritual or religious perspectives. It's a topic that has been contemplated by theologians, philosophers, and believers throughout history, and there might not be a single definitive answer. If you find yourself struggling with this question, it could be helpful to engage in discussions with spiritual leaders, mentors, or others who share your faith.

              " {'question': 'What do I need to know about the University of Toronto?',\n",
              "  'answer': 'Hey! I’m going into my 4th year at UofT (St George). Here are some *helpful* tips & tricks I’ve discovered over my last 3 years at UofTears.\\nThe Registrar’s office is your BFF. Academic Advising appointments are free, and can be made either by taking advantage of “drop in days” at your registrars office, or scheduled in advance. They’re helpful for figuring out the most efficient ways to fulfil program requirements (sometimes you can take 1 credit to fulfil 2 program req’s !!!). Academic Advising is truly a life saver, personally I try to schedule one before every course selection period.Degree Explorer can be accessed through ACORN & is super helpful for understanding how much progress you’re making in your program, it keeps track of all the credits you take and how they’ve been applied to help you achieve your degree. Being able to see how far along you are in your degree is really helpful (for me, personally) because sometimes it’s easy to feel like Uni is this super long, seemingly endless process and Degree Explorer lets you see that you’re truly making real progress!The two sexiest words ever are: “Student Discounts”. If you’re living on/near campus but don’t have a meal plan, or you’re living off campus but near the area, the Metro (grocery store) on Spadina & Bloor (by Spadina subway station) has student discount days on Tuesday & Wednesday. The Metro on 89 Gould st (Ryerson Campus) has the same discount on Thursday & Friday. Saving 10% might not sound like a lot, but even the smallest savings make a big difference in the long run.Hart House Gym is the best for working out if you’re not super athletic/just like going to do lowkey stuff and not feel weird about having all the *Varsity Athletes* “shredding” around you and being super intense. The Hart House pool is also really clean & very pretty for nice relaxing swims!Cool places to study at St. George Campus: 1) Over Easy (208 Bloor St West) they have bottomless coffee & if you’re nice and ask politely they will leave the pot at your table, buy some breakfast foods, & enjoy the quiet, cute aesthetic while you study to the smell of fresh bacon and eggs. 2) Robarts Library is a little overrated if you ask me (cough, cough, sorry UC kids, cough cough) BUT they offer really nice study rooms on the top floors that you can book ahead of time. If you book the ones that face St. George Street you get a lovely view of the CN Tower and the lake. It’s quiet, it’s pretty, it has so many outlets (!!!!!). 3) Bora Laskin Law Library on 78 Queens Park Cres. is suuuuuper pretty! the big room on the main floor has windows that overlook the Philosophy Park, so it’s peaceful. The tables are also huge so if you need to sprawl out and take up space this is the place for you!The 24 Hour McDonalds On Yonge st. Across From Charles st. Is Scary After 8pm Every Night Of The Week. Go To The One On Bloor St. Across From The ROM Instead.Academically Speaking: UofT is hard, I won’t lie. I’ve discovered that getting to know your profs through going to office hours is a really good way to boost your grades. More often than not, going to office hours with your questions, interests, thoughts & rough drafts is an amazing opportunity to learn the most! AND, believe it or not, Profs Love Talking (usually). If you start going to one office hour appointment every other week, or even once or twice a month your grades are more likely to be higher because you’re both engaging more with the material, and allowing the prof to help guide you through assignments! Not a lot of students take advantage of this opportunity and honestly, I think this has been the best thing Ive done for my GPA & my own learning. It’s like a free tutor session with a True Expert! Also, building friendships with profs that are teaching something you might want to go to Grad School for is a really good way to ensure you’ll have GREAT recommendation/reference letters for future applications!EXAM REPOSITORY!!! Sometimes old exams can be found online & it’s a really good way to know the layout and possible questions ahead of time. It’s like a cheat sheet except it’s totally legit & won’t get you into trouble.Don’t be afraid to ask for extensions! Make sure you ask politely, and well ahead of time. More often than not if you’re honest, polite, and show that you’re planning ahead the professor is more than happy to give you a little extra time on papers/big assignments. Don’t take advantage of it too much though, only use it when you truly need it. Side Note: If you have Academic Accomodations you can ask for extensions through these accomodations & it’s a lot more official. If you have any kind of learnin needs scheduling an appointment with Academic Accomodation to register these needs is a good way to ensure you’re getting the support you need to do your best.\\nCongratulations on getting into UofT! This is very St. George campus based, but I hope it’s helpful! Goodluck!! :)\\n'},\n",

              "  'answer': \"No. Your brain and the synapses and chemical processes it goes through are a response to stimuli, external and internal. There are also several glands in your body that play a role in the development, production, and regulation of hormones within your body, such as the pituitary gland. Dopamine, norepinephrine, oxytocin, these are things normally regulated by the pituitary gland and released into the brain in response to certain situations.

              "  'answer': \"While I dislike this Phase 4, I don’t think it’s aimless.\\n Announcement of future MCU movies in San Diego Comic Con has shown what grand plan they have with these Phases.\\n Phase 4 is like an introductory phase, much like Phase 1 & 2, where many important characters were shown for the first time.\\nLet me briefly point out the new characters introduced in Phase 4.\\nWanda Vision - This web series was the first one in Phase 4. It showed the aftermath of Endgame, but more importantly it showed the transition between Wanda and Scarlett Witch. It introduced us to Scarlet Witch, who would be the main villain in Multiverse of Madness.The Falcon and the Winter Soldier - This web series focused on the journey of Sam Wilson into the new Captain America. With the announcement of a new Captain America movie, this web series now seems much more relevant.Loki - We have all been confused about how the multiverse will actually work, and this webseries told us about that. It also introduced us to the new villain, Kang the Conqueror, who would be the main villain in the next Avengers movie.Black Widow - It’s the most unimportant movie of Phase 4 whose only aim was to please some fans and introduce Yelena as the new Black Widow.What If - Again, this series explored the endless possibilities of events in the multiverse. It gives answers to the fans about how certain events would look under different circumstances.Shang Chi - Again, this movie introduced us to a new character, Shang Chi, who would play a pivotal role in future Avengers movies.Hawk Eye - This webseries gave us much needed deep insight into the life of Hawk-Eye, one of the few Avengers without any superpower. It also introduced us to Kate Bishop, who could potentially be the part of Young Avengers and would take on the mantle of Hawk-Eye from Clint.Eternals - This movie served as an introductory movie for the Eternals and the Celestials, who I believe will play a much larger role in future MCU movies.Spider-Man No Way Home - It answered the most important question, what is the multiverse and how tampering with it will affect the present universe. While there were no new characters involved, it showed the implication of messing with the multiverse. Also, it was a great fan service.Doctor Strange and Multiverse of Madness - Scarlett Witch, who was introduced in Wanda Vision, served as the main villain in this movie. It took from where NWH was left and showed the implications of tampering with the flow of time. It gave us glimpse about how much important this multi-verse travelling will be in future movies. It also introduced a new superhero, America Chavez.Moon Knight - While I don't find any way how this webseries is relevant to the current vision of MCU, but I do think that next season will answer that question as we’re introduced to a completely new and different kind of superhero.Thor, God of Love and Thunder - In my view, this is the weakest Phase 4 movie. At least, Black Widow introduced a new member, which can not be said for this movie, though. The only new members introduced are those who could potentially be the members of Young Avengers.She-Hulk - Again, a new character is introduced who will play a pivotal role in future Ms. Marvel movie.\\nSo, considering all these facts, I think Phase 4 is not aimless.\\n On the contrary, this Phase introduces us to all new characters who would play a pivotal role in Phase 5 & 6, and would ultimately set up the Avenger 4 and 5.\\nBefore San Diego Comic Con, I too doubted the relevance of this Phase, but with the announcement of new Avengers movies, all things seems to fit in place.\\n I will not term this Phase as good, as there are many bad movies, but this Phase will serve as a bridge to cross from Phase 3 to Phase 5.\\n\"},\n",

I decided to assume, for one week only, that no god existed. So much fell into place in that week and world began to make more sense. I could even start to appreciate the miracle(!) of nature more readily.\\n Anyway, I stuck with the idea of ‘no god’. The basic science I’ve learned since then seems to back this up so I’ve stayed with that.\\n Some have accused me of being closed minded due to my non-belief. They are wrong. I had to open up my mind way beyond my previous boundaries in order understand that the likelihood of a god existing is infinitesimally small.\\n'},\n",

              "  'answer': 'I struggle with infinity when I was about 8 years old. I always slept outside on a cot, in a sleeping bag, on our patio.\\n One night I was trying to wrap my brain around infinity. I pictured myself flying through the Universe as fast as I could go. I kept going and going and going, maybe for 20 minutes in my head. Then I thought, I still haven’t put a dent in infinity. No matter how long I traveled, it never got me closer to infinity.\\n I think I finally came to grips about infinity.\\n Or, think of the largest number you can think of, then add 1 to it.\\n Or, You can write as many zeros after a number as you like and it still doesn’t get you any closer.\\n 100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 + 1. Still, you are infinity away from infinity.\\n This is why exponential notation is important.\\n 1 x 10^9999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999 is a hell of a big number. A 1 followed by 999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999 zeros. That’s a lot of zeros.\\n So we move to factorial expression.\\n 1! = 1 x 1 = 1\\n 2! = 1 x 2 = 2\\n 3! = 1 x 2 x 3 = 6\\n 4! = 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 = 24\\n 5! = 24 x 5 = 120\\n 6! = 120 x 6 = 720\\n 7! = 720 x 7 = 5,040\\n 8! = 5,040 x 8 = 40,320\\n 9! = 40,320 x 9 = 362,888\\n 10! = 362,888 x 10 = 3,628,800\\n 11! = 3,628,880 x 11 = 39,916,800\\n So, you can see how quickly the factorial can rise.\\n So now think of the largest number you can think of and take its factorial.

No—by custom or fear? Yes.\\n I grew up in Massachusetts, a fairly liberal, “blue” state, but its racial history has hardly been rosy. While things like Jim Crow and racial violence was relatively rare segregation via social pressures existed. Boston was still integrating schools well into the 1970s, and in the 1980s when a white man murdered his pregnant wife and claimed it was a “black carjacker” it pushed the city to a near race-riot after.\\n I grew up in an upper-middle class mostly white suburb where the population lived in fear of the “city” near by. I distinctly recall white adults confiding to each other that if they saw a “black guy” walking down their street they would “call the police” because “he doesn't belong there.” What strikes me is this was said simply, matter-of-factually, not as a boast, or hysteria or even whispered admission, it was just…stated as if it was the most natural cause-and-effect. As if that’s what one is supposed to do.\\n And that seems to be rather common for white people to catch the glimpse of a black person and then dial 911.\\n There are towns where “driving while black” will get you pulled over. There have been black teenagers walking home to be stopped by “concerned citizens,” and had violence done to them. In New York City there is the infamous “stop and frisk.”\\n Other places African-Americans will avoid out of memory. The area around where the infamous Rosewood Florida massacre happened was avoid by African-Americans—especially after dark for decades—a community that had once been over 40% black was basically 100% white for eighty years after.\\n [LINKED_TEXT: Rosewood massacre - Wikipedia] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosewood_massacre#Culture_of_silence]\\n\"},\n",

Most ramen shops like to keep it relatively simple with only perhaps three to five ingredients. It’s not like a pizza with ‘everything’ on it. With ramen, less is more.\\nSo, I apologize to that very long prelude to my actual answer to this question.\\n What can you add to make ramen taste better?\\n I would say, add the toppings which you think tastes good to you.

I could suggest some of the things in the picture above, but if you don’t like the taste of kamaboko (that pink and white fish cake above), for example, then what tastes good to me is going to be useless to you.\\n As previously mentioned, the broth is the heart, soul and spirit of ramen.

A militarized anti-terrorist organization.\\n Those guys look like this.\\n Herman Gunther.\\nAverage UNATCO trooper.\\nThat first guy is Herman Gunther. He’s a “mech,” or a full-body prosthesis cyborg. He is a walking tank in the employ of UNATCO. He is a living weapon who is uncomfortably bloodthirsty and violent.\\n “Mech” is a sneering term of disparagement. Because to the average man on the street? He’s the boot of the oppressor. He’s a big scary killing machine. But he has one of the nominal good guy badges of office.\\n His co-worker Anna Navarre is every bit as cheerfully as bloodthirsty.\\nNow in Deus Ex, you had simple moral choices that affected dialogue you got. If you murder every terrorist in your path, both Anna and Gunther approve of you. If you don’t they think you’re too soft on crime. Too weak. And they tell you so. Loudly.\\n Which should really remind you of this:\\nAnd this:\\nYep. Deus Ex predicted Homeland Security and The Patriot Act and the increasing militarization of our police. All under the pretext of the War on Terror.\\n The most cynical of us thought the Iraq War was about oil. Which was half-correct. And more or less in the right direction.\\n You know what else cyberpunk talks about? Economic inequality and the consolidation of all things by megacorps.\\n In the Alien franchise, this entity is Weyland-Yutani.\\nJust to name one example.\\n Weyland-Yutani owns colonies and either owns or functionally controls its own private army in the Colonial Marines. It is functionally a nation into itself.\\n This mirrors entities like Walmart and Amazon.\\n And Amazon is looking to get into delivering groceries by drones. The same kind of automated technology we used to assassinate people with.\\n It doesn’t get more cyberpunk than this.\\n If Star Trek is an idealized and utopian vision of technology being used to achieve a peaceful and enlightened post-scarcity culture. Cyberpunk is its dark opposite.\\n Cyberpunk says that technology will be used to generate wealth. But most of that wealth will be consolidated in the 1%. The gains made from technology are more likely to put you out of a job than to improve your standard of living.\\n The increased availability of information won’t be used to educate, but will instead overwhelm us and allow an entirely new form of warfare to waged with ideas and propaganda.\\n In Deux Ex, the evil rich billionaire has an engineered plague that he uses to keep the common man down.\\n Bob Page.\\nThe Grey Death.\\nHe has a “vaccine” of course. Which he uses to bribe and control influential politicians. The vaccine doesn’t actually cure the Grey Death though. So he can build a limited supply of vaccine and then sell it at hyper-inflated prices.\\n Mwa. Ha. Ha.\\nAnd the sad thing is?\\n It all came true. We already are living in the cyberpunk future.\\n Sure, we will have self-driving cars. Maybe we’ll have robots. We have smart phones and social media. And we have VR video games in the prototype stage. But all those toys come with the horrible dystopia.\\n Facebook sells your personal information. Two decades ago, this would’ve been thought to have been the slippery slope that would open the gates to a police state. Or at least given cart blanche to private corporations to intrude on personal lives. No more privacy.\\n Nobody really cares though. So we just live with cyberbullying, Russian fake news campaigns and 4chan being able to find you anywhere on the planet from a few photos.

              " {'question': 'What is a good gun for home defense?',\n",
              "  'answer': 'Honestly, any quality full-sized handgun with a quality light on it will be fine. All you have to do is be able to shoot it well. The size of the handgun should be manageable in most people’s hands. I could whole heartily recommend a Glock, M&P, S&W revolvers, Springfield/Colt 1911s, anything H&K etc.\\n Why a light? Because if you plan on shooting someone, you should be able to see who/what you are shooting at before you pull a trigger.\\n Since everyone else in this question wants to discuss a shotgun or a AR15, I guess I will.\\n Shotguns are nice. But they are rather large. Their spread is nowhere near as big as what people think in the confines of a home. With modern ammo, the spread is generally less than 1 inch per yard (actually closer to 0.3–0.5″). So, unless you live in an oddball house/mansion/ranch you won’t have a shot under 10 yards. You’ll most likely have a shotgun that has a 24″+ barrel.\\n AR15 isn’t a bad choice. 5.56 is known to be very barrier sensitive, breaking up in modern building materials at “home defense” distances. Downside is that they can be long guns and they are EXTREMELY loud and disorienting. I would strongly suggest investing in a suppressor.\\n'},\n",

Just one example for all:\\nEDIT: It appears that simple cartoon does not work and I owe a serious answer that is: Intelligent design is opposed by so many scientists because ID is pseudoscience.\\nTo do the science right you should build on positive evidence that something exists or is happening. The ID is based on the negative evidence that something does not exist, e.g. missing links in evolution, irreducible complexity.\\nThen you should postulate falsifiable hypotheses and test them. E.g. natural variation, spontaneous mutations, selection. Actually, we witnessed speciation in wild nature, the evolution of new genes in the test tube, abiogenesis in the test tube etc. Based on those hypotheses that stand you may formulate a Theory of Evolution.

This will help you understand how your body responds to different foods, activities, and medications. It will also guide you in making necessary adjustments to your treatment plan.Medications and insulin if necessary: If lifestyle changes alone are not enough to control your blood sugar, your healthcare provider may prescribe medications or insulin therapy to help manage your diabetes. It's important to take medications as prescribed and follow your healthcare provider's instructions.Stress management: Practice stress-reducing techniques such as deep breathing, meditation, yoga, or engaging in hobbies you enjoy. High stress levels can affect blood sugar levels, so managing stress is beneficial for overall health.Regular medical check-ups: Schedule regular check-ups with your healthcare provider to monitor your blood sugar levels, assess your overall health, and make any necessary adjustments to your treatment plan.\\nRemember, everyone's diabetes management plan may vary, so it's important to work closely with your healthcare provider to develop an individualized approach that suits your needs.\\n\"},\n",

They were killed, raped and every inhumane torture that could be imagined was endured by the Kashmiri pandits.\\n If you want to know how biased was the Jammu & Kashmir Constitution, I’d like to introduce a few points in its constitution\\n Some people have seen the government’s action as “unabashed majoritarianism\". Whereas, if there ever was any unabashed and constitutionally sanctioned majoritarianism anywhere in India, it was in J&K through Article 370.\\nThe Constitution of this Muslim-majority state did not have the word “minorities\" anywhere in it. Unlike in the Indian Constitution, their rights were not protected.\\nJ&K was also the only Indian state with no tribal rights (and the state had no right to education either).\\n And it should be our national shame that we allow these hypocrites to freely talk of majoritarianism while staying silent about the 20th century’s swiftest forced exodus of a minority community—Hindu Pandits from Kashmir in 1990.\\n Fun Fact: Hindu and Sikh refugees from West Pakistan remained non-PR second-class citizens, while Uighur Muslims from Xinjiang were granted PR status. And we are supposed to believe that Kashmiri Muslims have become second-class citizens when in reality, actual second-class citizens now have full citizen rights.\\nTo talk about the main hurdle that has hampered the economic growth of Kashmiris.\\n #2 How was Kashmir a haven for terrorists?\\nThe man we see in the center is Burhan Wani, a commander of Hizbul Mujahideen, a terrorist organization responsible for martyring many Indian soldiers and civilians. He was gunned down by our armed forces in 2016.\\nWhat would you expect after a terrorist is eliminated?\\nThe people would rejoice and the leaders of Kashmir will applaud the Armed forces. But the reaction was totally opposite than expected.\\n Article 370 was a hurdle on the way to get rid of such elements and after its revocation, the terrorism problem will get solved once and for all.\\n Many people would debate this point, but the fact is that Since the abrogation of Article 370, Kashmiri youths joining terrorist ranks dropped by more than 40%. As a direct effect of the abrogation of Article 370 of the Indian Constitution, the security situation in Jammu and Kashmir has increased manifold and is now, in fact, better than ever.\\n According to a report by the Union Ministry of Home Affairs, incidents of terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir have declined by about 36% after the abrogation of Article 370.\\n Source: [LINKED_TEXT: Since abrogation of Article 370, Kashmiri youths joining terrorist ranks dropped by more than 40%] [URL: https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/since-revocation-of-article-370-kashmiri-youths-joining-terrorist-ranks-dropped-by-more-than-40/articleshow/77227229.cms?utm_source=contentofinterest&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=cppst]\\n [LINKED_TEXT: Effect of Article 370 abrogation: Security situation in Kashmir better than ever, details Home Ministry report] [URL: https://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-effect-of-article-370-abrogation-security-situation-in-kashmir-better-than-ever-details-home-ministry-report-2834694]\\nHow will Kashmir be in the next 10 years?\\nWith J&K a Union territory, the central government must ensure that funds are deployed properly and don’t line the pockets of a few families and their cronies.\\n However, it will take time before the industry feels that the valley is a safe bet. Pakistan will try to up its terrorist game. Also, when the US withdraws its troops from Afghanistan, some of the Taliban’s resources will be available to Pakistan to be re-directed towards Kashmir.\\n But, most importantly, the doubting Kashmiri must realize that Article 370 made him special in a very negative way. It kept him alienated from his nation for seven decades. No Malayali, Gujarati, Assamese, and no Dogra or Ladakhi has lost his identity because he is an Indian. India has opened her arms. It is now up to skeptical Kashmiris to accept the offer.\\nConclusion: The main motive was to introduce equality and end the problem of terrorism in Kashmir and I am of the firm belief that Kashmir will emerge one of the best places in our country by the next decade with greater level of social equality and economic stability.\\n Jay Hind!\\n'},\n",

              "  'answer': 'Handgun bullets used for self defense are not “sharp” because they are not designed to penetrate like the rifle bullets you displayed. Those travel at very high velocities and are designed to penetrate thick skin and heavy bones to reach a big animal’s vital organs and kill it.\\n A bullet shot into a human being is designed to be fired at much lower velocities and to penetrate deep enough to damage a vital organ BUT not exit the body where an innocent bystander could be hit. The bullets are designed to EXPAND in the body and expend 100% of their energy in the body. The best way to do that is with a hollow point design which is not pointy sharp. A sharp bullet will go through the body and carry much of its energy away from the body. Not the best way to achieve the goal which is to STOP a deadly threat.\\n The goal is NOT to kill but to STOP. A .45 ACP bullet traveling at 900 FPS may expand to double its original diameter or more in the body. It creates a pretty big wound cavity in the body and that increases the likelihood of hitting a vital organ or initiating shock and quick unconsciousness or even death.\\n Rifle bullets travelling at say 2,500 fps create a huge shock in the body but often pass out of the body. The person may ultimately collapse or die but that may take some time… time enough for the bad guy to kill you. Hence the necessity to STOP the threat and do so ASAP. Note that some rifle ammunition like the 5.56 mm NATO rounds often have bullets that tend to spall around in the body and that is a deadly combination… high velocity and changes of direction WITHIN the body. Many enemy soldiers have discovered this fact to their great chagrin.\\n I’m not going to get into the debate about handgun vs rifle vs shotgun for self defense. People are passionate about all the choices. I have all three at my disposal for home defense. I carry what I am allowed to carry by law. But in every case, I use bullets suited to the task they are charged to perform and the firearm delivering them. For my handguns I use Federal LE HST .45 ACP or Golden Sabre 125 gr. .357 Magnum. These are all hollow points (not sharp) but very very good ammunition for self defense. I load my AR with 55 gr Corbon DPX. My 12 GA is loaded with Winchester Super-X 3″ #1 buckshot. Each “bullet” or bullets in the case of the shotgun is chosen for its self-defense effects, accuracy and reliability.\\n As others have said, different bullets do different things for different reasons but this is the logic behind hollow point bullets vs rifle bullets. Hope that helps.\\n'},\n",

              " {'question': 'Which is the best car brand in the world?',\n",
              "  'answer': 'Ford Mustang\\n In the first six months of production in 1964, the Mustang was the fastest-selling car in history. It has since become an icon of style and performance among American automobiles, escorting in the “pony car” class of affordable sporty coupes with long hoods and short rear decks. Competitors raced to release their own versions, such as the Chevy Camaro, the Pontiac Firebird, and the Dodge Challenger. In 1964 alone, the Mustang was the pace car for the Indianapolis 500 and won both first and second in class at the Tour de France international rally. The museum is home to a 1967 Mustang Shelby GT 500 Fastback, designed by the legendary car constructor and race car driver Carroll Shelby.\\nVW Beetle\\n Marketed as a car that anyone could afford, the Volkswagen Beetle has been in production since 1936 and has a somewhat scandalous origin story (developed with the help of Ferdinand Porsche, the Beetle was the brainchild of Adolph Hitler, which is ironic, given it later came to be known as the “Love Bug”). This compact car had several notable innovations that set it ahead of its time, including rear-wheel drive and a rear-mounted engine. It was also the first car to have four-wheel independent suspension. To date, more than 21 million Beetles have been built, making it one of the most produced cars in history.\\nFord 150 Pickup Truck\\n Introduced in 1948 to replace car-based pickups of the early ’40s, the F150 is now in its 13th generation thanks to its durability and reliability. Refined over the decades in styling, design, bed, engine design, suspension, and platform, it has been the best-selling vehicle in the United States since 1982 and the best-selling pickup truck since 1977.\\nFord Model T\\n Part of the collection at the Gateway Auto Museum, the Model T (or “Tin Lizzy,” as Henry Ford called it) influenced every single automobile that came after it because of its groundbreaking and more cost-effective assembly-line production method. Between 1908 and 1927, 15 million models were produced. The increase of motorists as a direct result of this first affordable car led to the creation of America’s highways, gas stations, garages, and roadside motels.\\nPorsche 911\\n The Porsche 911 has been beloved on the racetrack and streets alike ever since it was first introduced in 1964 and is now one of the longest-standing sports cars ever. Air-cooled with an output of 130 horsepower and sophisticated rear suspension, as well as a horizontally opposed six-cylinder power plant engine, its continuous refinements over the years make it one of the most popular sports cars on the roads. In 1999, the 911 came in fifth place in the international “Car of the Century” competition\\n'},\n",
              " {'question': 'How difficult was it for you to find your life purpose?',\n",
              "  'answer': 'Praise be to Allaah.\\n Firstly:\\n One of the greatest attributes of Allaah is wisdom, and one of His greatest names is al-Hakeem (the most Wise). It should be noted that He has not created anything in vain; exalted be Allaah far above such a thing. Rather He creates things for great and wise reasons, and for sublime purposes. Those who know them know them and those who do not know them do not know them. Allaah has stated that in His Holy Book, where He says that He has not created mankind in vain, and He has not created the heavens and the earth in vain. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\\n “Did you think that We had created you in play (without any purpose), and that you would not be brought back to Us?”\\n So Exalted be Allaah, the True King: Laa ilaaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), the Lord of the Supreme Throne!”\\n [al-Mu’minoon 23:115, 116]\\n “We created not the heavens and the earth and all that is between them for a (mere) play”\\n [al-Anbiya’ 21:16]\\n “And We created not the heavens and the earth, and all that is between them, for mere play.\\n We created them not except with truth (i.e. to examine and test those who are obedient and those who are disobedient and then reward the obedient ones and punish the disobedient ones), but most of them know not”\\n [al-Dukhaan 44:38]\\n “HaaMeem.\\n [These letters are one of the miracles of the Qur’aan, and none but Allaah (Alone) knows their meanings.]\\n The revelation of the Book (this Qur’aan) is from Allaah, the AllMighty, the AllWise.\\n We created not the heavens and the earth and all that is between them except with truth, and for an appointed term. But those who disbelieve, turn away from that whereof they are warned”\\n [al-Ahqaaf 46:1-3]\\n Just as it is proven that there is wisdom behind the creation of man from the standpoint of sharee’ah (Islamic law), it is also proven from the standpoint of reason. The wise man cannot but accept that things have been created for a reason, and the wise man regards himself as being above doing things in his own life for no reason, so how about Allaah, the Wisest of the wise?\\n Hence the wise believers affirm that there is wisdom in Allaah’s creation, and the disbelievers deny that. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\\n “Verily, in the creation of the heavens and the earth, and in the alternation of night and day, there are indeed signs for men of understanding.\\n Those who remember Allaah (always, and in prayers) standing, sitting, and lying down on their sides, and think deeply about the creation of the heavens and the earth, (saying): Our Lord! You have not created (all) this without purpose, glory to You! (Exalted are You above all that they associate with You as partners). Give us salvation from the torment of the Fire”\\n [Aal ‘Imraan 3:190, 191]\\n And Allaah says, describing the attitude of the disbelievers towards the wisdom of His creation (interpretation of the meaning):\\n “And We created not the heaven and the earth and all that is between them without purpose! That is the consideration of those who disbelieve! Then woe to those who disbelieve (in Islamic Monotheism) from the Fire!”\\n [Saad 38:27]\\n Shaykh ‘Abd al-Rahmaan al-Sa’di (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:\\n Allaah tells us of His perfect wisdom in creating the heavens and the earth, and that He has not created them in vain, i.e., in play with no beneficial purpose.\\n “That is the consideration of those who disbelieve” in their Lord, because they think that which does not befit His Majesty.\\n “Then woe to those who disbelieve (in Islamic Monotheism) from the Fire!” Allaah created the heavens and earth in truth for truth. He created them so that His slaves might understand the completeness of His Knowledge and Power and the extent of His Might, and that He Alone is the One to be worshipped, and not those who have not created even an atom in the heavens or on earth. And that they might know that the Resurrection is true and that Allaah will judge between the people of good and evil. The one who is ignorant of the wisdom of Allaah should not think that Allaah will treat them equally when judging them. Hence Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\\n “Shall We treat those who believe (in the Oneness of Allaah Islamic Monotheism) and do righteous good deeds as Mufsidoon (those who associate partners in worship with Allaah and commit crimes) on earth? Or shall We treat the Muttaqoon (the pious) as the Fujjaar (criminals, disbelievers, the wicked)?”\\n [Saad 38:28]\\n This does not befit Our wisdom and Our judgement. End quote.\\n Tafseer al-Sa’di, p. 712\\n Secondly:\\n Allaah has not created man to eat, drink and multiply, in which case he would be like the animals. Allaah has honoured man and favoured him far above many of those whom He has created, but many people insist on disbelief, so they are ignorant of or deny the true wisdom behind their creation, and all they care about is enjoying the pleasures of this world. The life of such people is like that of animals, and indeed they are even more astray. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\\n “while those who disbelieve enjoy themselves and eat as cattle eat; and the Fire will be their abode”\\n [Muhammad 47:12]\\n “Leave them to eat and enjoy, and let them be preoccupied with (false) hope. They will come to know!”\\n [al-Hijr 15:3]\\n “And surely, We have created many of the jinn and mankind for Hell. They have hearts wherewith they understand not, and they have eyes wherewith they see not, and they have ears wherewith they hear not (the truth). They are like cattle, nay even more astray; those! They are the heedless ones”\\n [al-A’raaf 7:179]\\n It is well known to wise people that the one who does a thing knows more about the wisdom behind it than anyone else and for Allaah is the highest description (cf. al-Nahl 16:60); He is the One Who has created mankind and He knows best the wisdom behind the creation of mankind. No one would dispute this with regard to worldly matters. All people are certain that their physical faculties have been created for a reason. The eye is for seeing, the ear is for hearing, and so on. Does it make sense for his physical faculties to have been created for a reason but for himself to have been created in vain? Or does he not agree to respond to the One Who created him when He tells him of the reason behind his creation?\\n Allaah has told us that the creation of the heavens and the earth, and of life and death, is for the purpose of testing, so as to test man. Whoever obeys Him, He will reward him, and whoever disobeys Him, He will punish him. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\\n “And He it is Who has created the heavens and the earth in six Days and His Throne was on the water, that He might try you, which of you is the best in deeds. But if you were to say to them: “You shall indeed be raised up after death,” those who disbelieve would be sure to say, “This is nothing but obvious magic”\\n [Hood 11:7]\\n “Who has created death and life that He may test you which of you is best in deed. And He is the AllMighty, the OftForgiving”\\n [al-Mulk 67:2]\\n From this test results a manifestation of the names and attributes of Allaah, such as Allaah’s names al-Rahmaan (the Most Gracious), al-Ghafoor (the Oft Forgiving), al-Hakeem (the Most Wise), al-Tawwaab (the Accepter of Repentance), al-Raheem (the Most Merciful), and other names of Allaah.\\n One of the greatest reasons for which Allaah has created mankind – which is one of the greatest tests – is the command to affirm His Oneness (Tawheed) and to worship Him alone with no partner or associate. Allaah has stated this reason for the creation of mankind, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):\\n “And I (Allaah) created not the jinn and mankind except that they should worship Me (Alone)”\\n [al-Dhaariyaat 51:56]\\n Ibn Katheer (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:\\n i.e., I have created them so that I may command them to worship Me, not because I have any need of them. ‘Ali ibn Abi Talhah said, narrating from Ibn ‘Abbaas: “except that they should worship Me (alone)” willingly or unwillingly. This is the view favoured by Ibn Jareer. Ibn Jurayj said: i.e., except that they should know Me. Al-Rabee’ ibn Anas said: “Except that they should worship Me”, i.e., for the purpose of worship. End quote.\\n Tafseer Ibn Katheer, 4/239\\n Shaykh ‘Abd al-Rahmaan al-Sa’di (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:\\n Allaah, may He be exalted, created mankind to worship Him and to know Him by His names and attributes, and to enjoin that upon them. Whoever submits to Him and does what is enjoined upon him will be one of those who are successful, but whoever turns away from that, they are the losers. He will inevitably gather them together in the Hereafter where He will reward or punish them for what He commanded and forbade them to do. Hence Allaah mentions how the mushrikeen (polytheists) denied the reward or punishment, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):\\n “But if you were to say to them: ‘You shall indeed be raised up after death,’ those who disbelieve would be sure to say, ‘This is nothing but obvious magic’”\\n [Hood 11:7]\\n i.e., if you were to speak to these people and tell them about the Resurrection after death, they would not believe you, rather they would reject your words vehemently and deny the message you brought, and they would say, ‘This is nothing but obvious magic,’ but in fact it is obvious truth.

Tax can be increased for people who can afford to pay more tax.\\n I am not a financial wizard, economist or a financial analyst. Am just a layman who do not know nuances of finance or economics. I know my pay, pay cuts and what comes into my pocket for spending and when I spend how much money goes out as tax. The higher percentage is due to increase in indirect tax by the latter’s regime who is always in favour of rich. Poor never know that they are paying tax and the raise in indirect taxes is hardly noticed by them. But, when there is raise in direct taxes which doesn't affect the poor, there will be a hue and cry from people liable to pay the same. And, the government promptly favours them as a populist measure.\\n So, in no way the latter can be a better PM, who cares for rich only.\\n\"},\n",

Since they do not come to a very fine point, a bullet does not usually make a tiny little hole.  The larger and blunter the bullet, the more it destroys the material it passes through, making a larger wound.  Many times, bullets are constructed with this is mind. Push a small needle with a fine point through some material and you will see how easily it glides through and leaves only a tiny hole with little damage. Now, try to push a blunt object like the end of a writing pen through the fabric and you will see that when it does go through it will leave a larger and more damaged hole in its wake.

              "  'answer': 'If they’re made from something thick enough, you could probably secure them using screws with either a finishing washer, which creates a pretty smooth ‘hump’ that wouldn’t bother a cat or a much bigger washer with a small hole and you can get those made from plastic, metal and even rubber. I’d probably use the finishing washer though. I’d also use some carpenters glue around the hole so it’ll have some extra strength from the glue and resist wear on the hole.\\n Depending on how long the tube is, a screw at each end might be enough to hold it, even if you have to drill a hole in the tube to gain adequate access for a screwdriver to turn the screws. But you also have to prevent it rolling from side to side, so it’ll need a block of some kind on each side to stop that.\\n If the cardboard is pretty thick, drill a screw-shaft size hole in it first. Dab on the glue and let it dry before you fasten it. Drill pilot holes in the mounting surface to make life easier.\\n Alternately, you may be able to use something like a pipe strap but a commercial pipe strap is quite small so you’d have to make them. A strap would stop rolling movement and hold it in place.\\n You might use heavy duty poly webbing to create them OR even better maybe, jute upholstery webbing. You could spread carpenters glue all over the jute webbing so that when it dries it’s stiff enough to stay put and it’ll glue it right to the cardboard too. Also a similar colour to cardboard, if that matters at all.\\n Screw the strap on each side to the flat surface using a fairly large washer to spread out the force so it’ll hold rather than pull through the webbing. For poly type webbing, just poke the hole with a hot nail heated in a candle flame, so the material melts around the hole. For jute, use glue to reinforce the hole and stop it from fraying.\\n If you’re really handy you could probably make metal straps out of something like a bar of aluminum stock. It’s easy to bend around a round form and easy to drill with HSS bits for holes for the screws.\\n You might choose to run a strap right through the tube from end to end inside it and screw that down at both ends to stop vertical slippage but it would not stop rolling so there needs to be something on the outside on each side so the tubes don’t roll and hold firmly in place.\\n A thought. If the tubes are not thick enough to hold a screw well enough, it’s not difficult to fix that using paper mache. Just wrap sheets of newsprint around the tubing using paper mache paste and if you add maybe six or seven layers, it’ll make the tube thicker, a lot stronger and tougher and it’s easy to paint the surface of the paper mache, or use Kraft packaging paper for the final layer so it still looks a lot like cardboard. You can also sand fully dried surfaces of paper mache if there are bumps or uneven spots.\\n That’s all I can think of at the moment.\\n'},\n",

              " {'question': 'What is the difference between Angular and AngularJS?',\n",
              "  'answer': 'Angular and AngularJS are both frameworks for building web applications, but they have distinct differences:\\n 1. Architecture: AngularJS is based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, where the application logic is divided into three components: the model (data), the view (presentation), and the controller (handles interactions). Angular, on the other hand, uses a component-based architecture called Angular Components. Components are self-contained and reusable building blocks that encapsulate the template, styles, and behavior.\\n 2. Language: AngularJS uses JavaScript (or ECMAScript 5) as its programming language. Angular, however, is built with TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript that includes additional features such as static typing and enhanced tooling support. TypeScript enables better maintainability, code readability, and improved developer productivity.\\n 3. Performance and Efficiency: AngularJS suffers from performance limitations due to its two-way data binding system, which constantly watches for changes in data and updates the UI accordingly. Angular addresses this issue with a more efficient change detection mechanism called Zone.js and implements a unidirectional data flow pattern. This improves performance and allows for better optimization in large-scale applications.\\n 4. Size and Compatibility: AngularJS is a smaller and lighter framework compared to Angular. AngularJS is suitable for smaller projects and is compatible with older browsers. Angular, on the other hand, has a larger codebase due to additional features and improvements, making it more suitable for complex and modern web applications. It focuses on supporting modern browsers and devices, leveraging newer web standards and technologies.\\n 5. Development Community: AngularJS has been around since 2010, and while it still has an active community, it is not growing at the same pace as Angular. Angular, which is a complete rewrite of AngularJS, was released in 2016 by Google. It has gained significant popularity and has a larger and more active community, which translates to better support, resources, and frequent updates.\\n In summary, AngularJS and Angular differ in their architecture, programming language, performance, size, compatibility, and development community. AngularJS is suitable for smaller projects and legacy browser support, while Angular is more robust, modern, and optimized for larger-scale applications.\\n In conclusion, preparing for an AngularJS interview, whether for beginners or advanced levels, can significantly enhance your chances of success. It is important to familiarize yourself with common interview questions to demonstrate your knowledge and understanding of the framework.\\n For beginners, focus on fundamental concepts such as two-way data binding, directives, controllers, services, and dependency injection. Be prepared to explain the key features and benefits of AngularJS and provide examples of how you have used it in projects.\\n As you advance, delve into more complex topics like custom directives, filters, routing, testing, and performance optimization techniques. Gain a deeper understanding of AngularJS modules, scopes, transclusion, and digest cycle.\\n Additionally, be prepared to discuss best practices, common challenges, and how to handle them in AngularJS development. Demonstrate your problem-solving skills and ability to write clean and maintainable code.\\n By diligently preparing for [LINKED_TEXT: AngularJS interview questions] [URL: https://www.wscubetech.com/blog/angular-interview-questions/], you can showcase your expertise, confidence, and suitability for AngularJS-related roles.

              " {'question': 'What is the string theory about?',\n",
              "  'answer': ' String theory is a theoretical framework in which the point-like particles of particle physics are replaced by one-dimensional objects called strings. String theory describes how these strings propagate through space and interact with each other. On distance scales larger than the string scale, a string looks just like an ordinary particle, with its mass, charge, and other properties determined by the vibrational state of the string. In string theory, one of the many vibrational states of the string corresponds to the graviton, a quantum mechanical particle that carries gravitational force. Thus string theory is a theory of quantum gravity.\\n String theory is a broad and varied subject that attempts to address a number of deep questions of fundamental physics. String theory has been applied to a variety of problems in black hole physics, early universe cosmology, nuclear physics, and condensed matter physics, and it has stimulated a number of major developments in pure mathematics. Because string theory potentially provides a unified description of gravity and particle physics, it is a candidate for a theory of everything, a self-contained mathematical model that describes all fundamental forces and forms of matter. Despite much work on these problems, it is not known to what extent string theory describes the real world or how much freedom the theory allows to choose the details.\\n'},\n",

              " {'question': 'What is the Ship of Theseus paradox?',\n",
              "  'answer': 'This is a very interesting thought process which has wider implications than just a philosophical question. In Jainism, this paradox can be explained by Anekant as we’ll see in this answer.\\n Let’s start by considering not just the start and end states of the ship but its in between states as well. That is, if the ship was composed of ’n’ parts, its states are defined by\\n A(0), A(1), A(2), …, A(n-1) and A(n).\\n A(0) is the start state.\\n A(i) is the state after parts 1, 2, … i are replaced with new ones.\\n A(n) is the end state (ie after all the parts are replaced with new ones)\\n Are A(0) and A(n) same? Before answering this, let’s answer the question:\\n Are A(0) and A(1) same? If yes, then by this same logic A(1) and A(2) are same and stretching this to A(n) we conclude that A(0) and A(n) are same too.\\n If A(0) and A(1) are different, then case closed. A(0) and A(n) are different too.\\n So answer the question — are A(0) and A(1) same or different?\\n They are actually same as well as different! While this feels like a paradox, it is actually not one.\\n It can be understood by how Jainism describes the “nature of objects”. An object (dravya) is composed of both properties — which is permanence and transience (and infinitely many more properties as well).\\n That is, an object forever keeps on changing while remaining the same.\\n Confused?\\n Consider an object, for example gold. It’ll take on multiple forms. Eg - a necklace, a bangle, a ring, a bar (biscuit), molten gold etc. Does this mean that gold changes all the time? Does this mean that gold remains the same?\\n It depends on the context. Its “nature” (ie its collection of properties, its “gold” nature) doesn’t change whether it is in the form of necklace, bangle, molten, ….\\n But its present form or state will keep on changing.\\n No matter what form it takes (changes to), its “gold” nature will never change. At the same time, its present state will never remain the same.\\n An object keeps on changing while remaining the same. It is never always permanent. It is never always transient. Conversely, it is always permanent. It is always transient. It depends on the context that one is talking about.\\n The same applies to the Ship of Theseus Paradox. The “nature” of the ship remains the same whether it is in A(0) or A(1) or … A(n). However, its present will keep of changing from A(0) to … A(n). The answer is not a simple yes or no. The answer is a mix of both.\\n This is the beautiful Jainism’s theory of Anekaant which can help solve this “paradox”.

The winter before we built our house, we had 2 weeks below -20F / -30C and 3 days of -40 and a city water main 14 feet under a plowed road froze.\\n 2) being run properly inside the house - not in exterior walls, so that heating the house keeps the pipes well above freezing.\\n3) by having frequent enough flow to keep warmer water moving past a frost-prone area. People do this by letting their faucets drip during a cold snap if their home’s plumbing was poorly designed/installed:\\n4) with heat-trace cable electrically heating the pipes:\\n5) having insulation slow the rate of heat loss. It won’t avoid freezing, but will delay it perhaps allowing heat trace or periodic flow to keep up with heat losses:\\n6) Recirculation of the water in a loop - rarely done for a single residence, some cities in Alaska use it to keep their city water mains from freezing.\\n 7) Building structures to contain all utilities such as Barrow’s / Utqiaġvik’s “utilidor” system:\\n8) Adding heat before distributing the water. Anchorage uses cold water to recondense steam at their gas-fired power plant which then raises the water temperature and allows it to get to the far ends of the system without freezing.\\n Or some combination of the above.\\n'},\n",

I noticed that the photo on the papers and the man sitting in front of me was completely different. I said “these are not your papers. This photo does not belong to you”. But the guy insisted that it is himself. I said “you are bald but the guy in the photo has hair”.\\n He said, “Oh doc, you don't know how my life is difficult and I lost my hair”.\\n I told him to tell the truth otherwise I am going to call the security. Finally he told the papers belong to his cousin but he was too busy to show up for the results. I was really angry for this behaviour. I refused the man and told his cousin to come ‘himself’. I did not alert authorities as I think he just wanted to finish the paperwork in behalf of his cousin.\\n Another fake was also interesting. An old lady in her 70s came for some complaints. She was a classical elderly Anatolian Muslim lady with headscarf (hijab) and long dress. I performed a physical examination. Something was weird but I wasn't able to explain what it was. I continued with the paperwork. Than I noticed something in her shopping bag. The bag was transparent and I could see inside of it. There was an identity card which was blue in color. (In Turkey, women have pink, men have blue identity cards.) I asked, “Do you have someone with you to help?’ She said “no”. I asked “So whose identity card is that?” She said “mine”. I was really confused. I had not performed a complete naked physical examination so I did not examine the genitals or breast (her complaint was not related). And the name was somehow appropriate for both sexes. I realized that the lady was an elderly transgender living in a village. I was surprised because she had answered my medical history questions as if she was a biological woman before I realized the situation. I did not go on about this issue because it was none of my business and not related to her complaints. But I hospitalized her because she needed inpatient care.

They would sleep on the floor, they would pee and shit on the floor.The doctors- residents and professors treat these patients as subjects. Like mere specimens to be observed and studied. Not people who have hearts and souls. They would bring some patients inside their lessons. Afterwards, they would let the patient eat with the buffet they set up.I know that these patients are also very hard to deal with. Some of them thrive on food and are very manipulative.

We only had therapy on a hallway in front of the medical conference room were doctors would pass us.

              " {'question': 'What are some first date tips?',\n",
              "  'answer': 'Ah, the thrilling world of first dates! It\\'s a time filled with anticipation, excitement, and perhaps a touch of nervousness. Fear not, my dear friend, for I am here to guide you through this delightful journey as your love guru. So, without further ado, let me share some enchanting first date tips that will surely set the stage for a magical connection.\\n1. Be Yourself, Unapologetically: Authenticity is the key to building a meaningful connection. Embrace your uniqueness and let your true self shine. Be genuine and honest, and don\\'t feel the need to put on a façade to impress your date. After all, the best relationships are built on a foundation of honesty.\\n2. Dress to Impress, Yet Comfortably: Dressing up for a first date shows that you value the occasion and your potential partner. Wear something that makes you feel confident and comfortable in your own skin. Remember, it\\'s not just about impressing your date but also feeling good about yourself.\\n3. Listen with Intent: Engage in active listening during your conversation. Show genuine interest in what your date has to say and respond thoughtfully. Ask open-ended questions that allow for deeper discussions, and let the conversation flow naturally. Remember, a good conversation is like a dance; it requires balance and connection.\\n 4. Smile and Exude Positive Energy: A warm smile can work wonders in creating a welcoming atmosphere. Radiate positive energy and approach the date with an open mind and heart. Leave any worries or negative thoughts behind, and embrace the present moment with enthusiasm.\\n 5. Leave the Phone Aside: In this digital age, it\\'s important to disconnect from our devices and connect with each other on a deeper level. Keep your phone out of sight and focus your attention on your date. By doing so, you\\'re showing respect and genuine interest, which can be immensely attractive.\\n 6. Be Mindful of Body Language: Non-verbal communication speaks volumes. Maintain good eye contact to establish a connection, and be aware of your posture, gestures, and facial expressions. Show confidence, but also be attentive to your date\\'s cues, ensuring a comfortable and engaging experience.\\n 7. Avoid Controversial Topics: While healthy discussions are essential, save the intense debates for later. Steer clear of controversial subjects such as politics or religion during the initial stages. Instead, focus on light-hearted topics that allow you to discover common interests and passions.\\n 8. Embrace Laughter and Humor: Laughter is a universal language of joy and connection. Don\\'t be afraid to show your sense of humor and share a few light-hearted moments. A good laugh can create a beautiful bond and help both of you relax and enjoy the experience.\\n 9. Show Appreciation and Gratitude: Small gestures can go a long way in creating a positive impression. Express gratitude for the date, your conversations, and the effort your date put into planning the outing. A simple \"thank you\" and a genuine compliment can make your date feel valued and appreciated.\\n 10. Follow your Intuition: Finally, trust your instincts and listen to your heart. While these tips provide guidance, every first date is unique. Pay attention to how you feel throughout the evening, and if there\\'s a genuine connection, embrace it. Sometimes, the most magical moments happen when we let our intuition guide us.\\n So, dear friend, armed with these first date tips, venture forth into the realm of romance with confidence and an open heart. Remember, the goal is not perfection but rather the beautiful exploration of human connection. Enjoy the experience, savor the moments, and let love find its way. May your first date be filled with joy, laughter, and the promise of a wonderful journey ahead!\\n'},\n",

              "  'answer': 'Led Zeppelin were THE Rock Gods of the 1970s. Jimmy Page was their leader. The untimely death of their drummer, John Bonham, cemented that reputation. Why? Because they were already in decline.\\n From the punchy and powerful early albums they had expanded their palette and triumphed with Led Zep IV featuring Black Dog, Rock’n’Roll (epic rock) Battle of Evermore (folky mystery), When The Levee Breaks (hard driving blues) and of course Stairway to Heaven (all of the above :-)). The creative sprawl of Physical Graffiti saw a band full of confidence and stretching their wings and looking down on the mere mortal rock bands.\\n The next 5 years saw two lacklustre albums (with some good bits) and an overblown drug-riddled tour which showed them playing patchily and without the passion and hunger the early Zep had shown. In 1979 they tried to affirm their status as Rock Gods with two huge shows at Knebworth. They didn’t. They looked scrappy and out of date. They were done.\\n Luckily Bonham’s death allowed them to escape the long mediocre slide to irrelevant has-beens. The band finished with them still clinging to their God status (just as The Beatles had).\\n Jimmy tried several projects in the 1980s. None of them came to much. In the 90s he revived LZ with the Page/Plant project. This was his most successful so far. However nothing he did really had much impact.\\n He enjoys being a Rock God. Only Led Zeppelin gives him this status. So he only does Led Zeppelin. Nothing he has done since or will do in the future will measure up in any way to what he achieved with LZ. Plant seems to enjoy making his music still, probably now more than ever. His sales are nowhere near what LZ used to move, but he is getting critical acclaim and making the music he likes.

              "  'answer': \"While there are still many tall buildings being constructed around the world, there are a few reasons why there may be fewer iconic skyscrapers like the Empire State Building or the Chrysler Building being built today:\\nCost: Building a tall skyscraper is an expensive undertaking, and the costs associated with designing and constructing a tall building continue to rise. The iconic skyscrapers of the past were often built during a time when building materials and labor costs were cheaper, and there was less regulation and bureaucracy involved in the building process.Location: Many of the world's tallest buildings today are being built in Asia and the Middle East, where land is less expensive and there is a greater demand for office and residential space. In contrast, in cities like New York, land is more expensive and there may be fewer opportunities to build tall buildings.Design and technology: While it is still possible to build very tall buildings, architects and builders are increasingly focused on creating structures that are environmentally sustainable, energy-efficient, and resilient to natural disasters. This may mean that the designs and technologies used in modern tall buildings are different from those used in the past, and may not necessarily result in the same type of iconic skyscrapers.Zoning and regulation: Many cities have zoning regulations and building codes that limit the height of buildings in certain areas, in order to protect historic buildings, preserve open space, or reduce congestion.

At least from what I assume the question is asking - why are there (naturally occurring) big cats and no (naturally occurring) big dogs.\\n In the same ecosystem with the same prey animals, there will always be larger cats than dogs.\\n First off we need to remember that hominins have caused a mass extinction event within the last 500,000 years and there were a lot more large animals than there are today.\\n So we can extend our list of big cats and big dogs to include sabre-toothed cats which were far bigger than the panthera line of big cats; large panthera big cats such as cave lions which were quite a bit larger than the Siberian Tiger; and large dogs such as the dire wolf.\\n This is possibly the largest dog, Epicyon. It is earlier than the canid wolves we are familiar with today with a shorter muzzle. Though its not a grey wolf in the picture, a grey wolf is almost the exact same size as the smaller dog in that picture.\\n Some lion species were perhaps 50% larger than the African lion (so another half a lion added to a lion).\\n And the largest sabre-toothed cats were even heavier for their size, as they had heavily muscled bodies designed for wrestling massive prey, rather than lighter bodies of lions and tigers designed to manipulate prey until they can get a bite.\\n So both cats and dogs have been much larger than they are today. The thing to remember is the places with the largest animals also tended to have the largest human populations which wiped out the large animals- the verdant forests of Europe, Asia and America have been almost wiped clean of large wildlife whereas dry places like Africa have had most of their wildlife left intact. Africa is seen today as a hotspot for large animals but in actuality it doesn’t have many large animals, which is why it is so intact today. Compared to extinct lions, extinct hyenas, extinct rhinos, extinct mammoths and mastodon et cetera, the African animals we think of as large today are by no means the largest - Africa wasn’t a great place for large animals on the whole.\\n The fact remains, though, that any environment that has had a dog (basically every habitat in the last 10 million years) has had a significantly larger cat.\\n For an identical habitat with identical prey animals, cats are bigger than dogs.\\n As for why, it is all down to hunting style.\\n Wolves today kill some of the largest animals in their habitats- musk ox, bison, the largest deer- are all prey to wolves. Similarly wild dogs and hyenas can kill prey many times their size.\\n For a cat to kill something so large, it has to be far more powerful and muscular than a dog does.\\n Predators will evolve to kill all prey in the environment. This means even the largest animals will have a predator except for the very largest (mammoths, elephants and indricotheres) which require the predators to become far too massive and specialised, hugely reducing the prey they can take.\\n So cats and dogs will both grow to the size required to take down the largest (except for the super large) prey in the environment. Dogs hunt larger animals by endurance, pack intelligence, and by nipping and biting to wear an animal out in the chase. Cats hunt larger animals by wrestling and grappling.\\n For dogs the size needed to kill a large prey animal can be much, much smaller than it can for cats.\\n This is why cats are, and in the past have been, bigger than dogs.\\n This Answer is copied from [LINKED_TEXT: Santino Dummett] [URL: https://www.quora.com/profile/Santino-Dummett]\\n'},\n",

He thinks previous Presidents have failed to connect with the various generations of Kims and that he, and he alone, has made some sort of diplomatic breakthrough.\\n His ignorance is astounding. The various Kims have been desperate to be seen as peers to superpowers. They have craved, for decades, to be taken seriously, not ignored as the hideous failed state of oppression and human suffering they are. Every President since Eisenhower had the option of meeting face to face with a Kim, but deliberately avoided doing so, as it would strengthen the grip of these oppressors on their own people.\\n But worse yet, Donald Trump is being played like a fiddle. Kim’s handlers have figured out (not that it’s very hard) that one simply has to pander to Trump’s ego and he thinks they’re great. He lets his guard down and will likely agree to foolish things that are in no one’s interests except the DPRK’s.\\n This is what happened in Singapore - President Trump agreed to halt joint military exercises with South Korea, a historically necessary event to ensure readiness in the event of an attack by North Korea. It also serves a grand symbolic function - to warn North Korea that any invasion would be met with the full force of American military might.\\n In exchange for this American concession, Kim gave nothing - only vague promises of peace and more ego kibbles for President Narcissist.\\n Now the fear is that President Willfully-Ignorant will make further concessions - recognition of the end of the Korean War, recognition of the DPRK as the legitimate government of the oppressed millions in North Korea, further reductions in the US military presence, in exchange for, again nothing from DPRK. No list of locations of nuclear facilities, no discussion of inspections that the DPRK is halting its nuclear program, only a series of calculated bromance love letters.\\n This President is a very dangerous idiot, whose blatant naivete could endanger everyone on the Korean penninsula and by extension, the world.\\n'},\n",

              "  'answer': 'Gal 2:21 “I do not set aside the grace of God, for if righteousness could be gained through the law, Christ died for nothing!\"\\n The purpose of the Letter to the Galatians was due to the church having false doctrine taught. That Doctrine was the doctrine of James, the half brother of Jesus. James’ doctrine is written in the book James. In his doctrine, James said works, and following the Jewish Law and customs was required to be a Christian. James wrote his letter in AD 45. At that time, James was a pastor of the Jerusalem Church. It was James that sent a delegation to the Antioch Church to demand the new Gentile converts follow his doctrine.\\n Paul and Barnabas established Gentile Churches East of Jerusalem. Paul, taught that salvation come from faith alone. When Paul discovered Law was being taught in his churches, he was furious. He sent a letter to the Christians in Jerusalem, demanding that the problem of false doctrine be resolved. In AD 50, the Council in Jerusalem met to settled the matter. The result was that Paul’ doctrine was correct. They sent out letters to the churches to let them know the doctrine of faith is the correct doctrine.\\n You may ask, why is the Book of James cannon? Because the Bible tells us of Church history, good and bad. Knowing the Book of James show us what Paul was fighting against, and so we will know false doctrine when we see it. The false doctrine makes sense to our fleshly mind, but is dead wrong as far as what God wants.\\n False doctrine is hard to stop. The Jewish believers continued to press their false doctrine. (It is still in most churches today)\\n Paul wrote his letter to the Galatians a year or so after the Council’s decision. James’ doctrine was being taught. Again, Paul was upset over the false doctrine being taught in a church he help establish. Paul begins his letter by condemning anyone that taught “works” had anything to do with salvation. He said any one teaching that doctrine is cursed. (The Curse of the LAW is death) Knowing that Paul is talking about the doctrine of James, makes his letter to the Galatians much more understandable.\\n To answer your question, Paul was saying that works had nothing to do with salvation. Faith alone brings eternal life. He says that if works brings salvation, there would have been no reason for Jesus to die.\\n'},\n",

Some might argue that the internet or smartphones are the most advanced technologies, while others might point to breakthroughs in fields like medicine, aerospace, or robotics.\\n However, I believe that the most advanced technology ever invented by humans is the semiconductor. Semiconductors are the basis for modern electronics, and they're used in everything from smartphones and laptops to cars and airplanes.\\n Semiconductors are made from materials like silicon, germanium, and gallium arsenide, and they're capable of controlling the flow of electrical current. This makes them incredibly useful for building electronic devices, as they can be used to create transistors, diodes, and other essential components.\\n The development of the semiconductor has been one of the most important technological breakthroughs in human history. It's what has made modern computing possible, and it's what has allowed us to create devices that are smaller, faster, and more efficient than ever before.\\n In recent years, there have been many advances in semiconductor technology, such as the development of 3D transistors, nanoscale fabrication techniques, and the use of new materials like graphene. These breakthroughs have opened up new possibilities for electronics and have paved the way for even more advanced technologies in the future.\\n In conclusion, while there are many advanced technologies that humans have invented, I believe that the semiconductor is the most significant.

              "  'answer': 'Question: How do airports ensure that luggage of one passenger is not picked by another at the baggage claim area?\\n Answer to this is an Yes and No. Though I fly international, this answer is restricted to Indian Airports. It may differ from country to country and even airport to airport on a day. Airlines while they take the check-in baggage affix a unique tag to it connecting it to its traveler. So far, in more than two decades of flying, though the baggage has so-called unique tag, never seen anyone checking or airport have a process in practice for assurance that baggage goes to its respective owner.\\n Interestingly, it is not only the check-in baggage that are at the risk of picked up by another passenger but even cabin baggage are subjected to someone picking it up purposely as they carry expensive items including laptops.\\n Once I was flying from Chicago, US to Delhi, India. After non-stop several hours of flying, flight reached the Delhi Airport, the biggest airport of India. All passengers who have to catch a connecting flight, we walked from one end of the airport to the other side where domestic flights start. As part of the security process, we have to go through screening including our cabin baggage, which we carry with us.\\n Delhi is one city in India, where one fear for all sort of aggressiveness, cheating, robbery and violence. Myself and many friends, relatives, colleagues of our organization have tons of relatively bitter experience in this city including many losing their mobiles including official ones in this city. I was double careful to make sure myself and my things stay safe though it is still inside the airport.\\n There was lot of crowd at the security screening area making me worried still more. I was carrying important and expensive items in my cabin trolley (American Tourister) including laptops (personal & official), travel documents, expensive DSLR camera with its accessories including multiple lenses, backup drives and more. As we know, the way the security screening works is we have leave our things in the X-ray screening queue and go for body screening / frisking, which is a separate queue. In short, we and our things goes in a separate queue.\\n As a process, I placed small items like mobiles, watch, belt, wallet in trays and bigger items like backpack and trolleys directly on the queue for X-ray scanning and went to the queue for body frisking. Due to crowd and being in a city known for crime I was sure worried and tried to have a watch on my things as much as possible. On my turn I finished body frisking and came out to collect my things, it was less than 3 minutes but to my horror, when I quickly went to collect my baggage the worst feared happened, my trolley was not there in the queue where I kept for X-ray scanning.\\n Frantically searched every possible place hoping someone misplaced it but it was not seen anywhere. Security personnel of the airport sure are the excellent ones. On seeing me searching, one of the security personnel came to me and asked me what happened, I explained him my baggage is missing. He immediately alerted his colleagues and assured that it cannot go missing as the entire area is under video surveillance. He personally came with me and took me to the places where passengers be after the security check.\\n Very close the check-in area there was a family standing with one aged person, one middle aged man probably his son, a lady, one aged lady and two kids. The aged person was decently dressed, he was standing holding a trolley, which was very similar to mine. Myself and the security personnel went to him and when I explained him I lost a baggage of mine and it was similar to what he was holding. He angrily shouted at me saying it is his baggage and the whole family joined him in the shouting.\\n We moved away and we went to different terminal areas on two floors. The security personnel mentioned that there are more than four flight leaving the airport in another 30 minutes and after that there is no way to trace it even though the video can show who picked it up. In his wireless he already informed his associates about this. It was more than 15–20 minutes we kept check the terminals and for people with similar trolley.\\n With no luck, we returned back and on the way I saw the family again. They were waiting to get into the flight to Nagpur. This time my instinct screamed to check him again. As if I am possessed, I straight went to him caught the trolley from the old man and opened the front zip where I always keep the copy of flight ticket. As my instinct said, yes it was my trolley. The security personnel got really angry and he was holding the passenger and said he will make sure he goes behind the bars and asked me check the items inside.\\n Trolley was number locked and when I opened everything was intact. my nearly 30 minutes of frantic search with lot of tension of losing so many important things including my items for my kids along with most important office items. I was relieved, the whole family pretended as if nothing wrong happened. First time in my life I was so shocked to see a whole family was part of such a bold robbing of a trolley of other person right in such a big and busy airport.\\n While the old man kept quiet, old lady and probably her daughter-in-law started shouting and asking why not we leave them as I got my baggage back. I don’t want to disgrace these ugly creatures in front of the very young kids creating a scar on their mind about their dad and grandfather. I requested the security personnel to leave them. Though he was so angry coz of roaming around the airport for nearly 30 minutes due to this fraud and robbing family, he accepted my request.\\n I profusely thanked him and rushed to the terminal to catch my connecting flight, which already started boarding by this time. This incident etched in my mind forever and in fact equipped me with required alertness. Now a days I put the BLE blue-tooth tag inside the baggage (both check-in and cabin) so that within 5–10 meter radius the mobile app will show the vicinity and also help me in getting the baggage pretty quickly from the conveyor.\\n BTQ: To answer the question, to my experience, till date, though baggage has unique tag put by airlines, in real world there is no protection from someone picking a wrong baggage by mistake or purposely. No one check who is picking which baggage. Having an eye on our baggage (at least electronically) and collecting the baggage promptly is the only best way to protect our baggage at least when collecting the baggage and before leaving the airport. In short, airport does nothing in effect to prevent someone picking someone’s baggage unless and until someone raise alarm or complaint of missing baggage, by the time baggage would have left the airport and disappeared into the cosmos of population.\\n'},\n",

              "  'answer': 'Nuclear power plants are still just steam generators. What would it take to actually harness the power of the atom? By that I mean, use the radiation directly without so many conversions, i.e. radiation-heat-steam-mechanical-electricity?\\n The problem is most semiconductor based ways of converting heat directly to electricity using thermoelectric generators (TEG) need very high temperature sources, and universally suffer from poor power density meaning that very large arrays will be needed to produce the same amount of energy as a steam turbine supplied from the same heat source. Since the energy available from a single thermocouple is very small, arrays of thermocouples must be used to construct thermoelectric devices capable of handling practical amounts of power. Higher power devices can be made by connecting thermocouples in series to increase the voltage capability and in parallel to increase the current capacity. Such an array of thermocouples is called a thermopile.\\n[LINKED_TEXT: Thermoelectric generator - WikipediaDevice that converts heat flux into electrical energy A thermoelectric generator ( TEG ), also called a Seebeck generator , is a solid state device that converts heat flux ( temperature differences) directly into electrical energy through a phenomenon called the Seebeck effect [1] (a form of thermoelectric effect ). Thermoelectric generators function like heat engines , but are less bulky and have no moving parts. However, TEGs are typically more expensive and less efficient. [2] Thermoelectric generators could be used in power plants and factories to convert waste heat into additional electrical power and in automobiles as automotive thermoelectric generators (ATGs) to increase fuel efficiency . Radioisotope thermoelectric generators use radioisotopes to generate the required temperature difference to power space probes. [2] Thermoelectric generators can also be used alongside solar panels . [3] [4] History [ edit ] In 1821, Thomas Johann Seebeck discovered that a thermal gradient formed between two different conducting material (has electromagnetic property) can produce electricity. [5] [6] At the heart of the thermoelectric effect is the fact that a temperature gradient in a conducting material results in heat flow; this results in the diffusion of charge carriers. The flow of charge carriers between the hot and cold regions in turn creates a voltage difference. In 1834, Jean Charles Athanase Peltier discovered the reverse effect, that running an electric current through the junction of two dissimilar conductors could, depending on the direction of the current, cause it to act as a heater or cooler. [7] Efficiency [ edit ] The typical efficiency of TEGs is around 5–8%, although it can be higher. Older devices used bimetallic junctions and were bulky. More recent devices use highly doped semiconductors made from bismuth telluride (Bi 2 Te 3 ), lead telluride (PbTe), [8] calcium manganese oxide (Ca 2 Mn 3 O 8 ), [9] [10] or combinations thereof, [11] depending on application temperature. These are solid-state devices and unlike dynamos have no moving parts , with the occasional exception of a fan or pump to improve heat transfer. If the hot region is around 1273K and the ZT values of 3 - 4 are implemented, the efficiency is approximately 33-37%; allowing TEG\\'s to compete with certain heat engine efficiencies. [12] As of 2021, there are materials (some containing widely available and inexpensive arsenic and tin) reaching a ZT value > 3; monolayer AsP 3 {\\\\displaystyle {\\\\ce {AsP3}}} (ZT = 3.36 on the armchair axis); n-type doped InP 3 {\\\\displaystyle {\\\\ce {InP3}}} (ZT =  3.23); p-type doped SnP 3 {\\\\displaystyle {\\\\ce {SnP3}}} (ZT = 3.46); p-type doped SbP 3 {\\\\displaystyle {\\\\ce {SbP3}}} (ZT = 3.5).

(AMTEC) These can use lower temperature heat, but suffer from poor efficiency\\n[LINKED_TEXT: Alkali Metal Thermal Electric Generators AMTECDirect Conversion of Heat Energy to Electrical Energy (2) Alkali Metal Thermal Electric Converter (AMTEC) The AMTEC is an electrochemical device for the direct conversion of heat to\\r\\n                          electrical power. It uses a recirculating \\r\\n                          alkali metal (Sodium or Potassium) working fluid passing through a solid electrolyte in a closed circuit to produce\\r\\n                        an electron flow in an external load. AMTEC devices depend on the unique properties of some solid ceramic electrolytes such as β\" or P\" Alumina which, due to their crystal structure, are very good\\r\\n  conductors of ions but poor conductors of electrons. The working fluid  is driven around a closed thermodynamic   cycle between a heat source and a heat sink  held at different temperatures and, during the vapour phase of the cycle, the available work from the isothermal expansion of the working fluid as it passes through the electrolyte is converted directly into electric power. AMTEC Operating Principle The diagram below shows the basic system components. The thermodynamic cycle works as follows: The solid electrolyte BASE which is a conductor of\\r\\npositive ions but an insulator to electrons is located in the Sodium working fluid circuit and a high temperature difference is maintained across it. Heat is added at the anode side increasing the temperature  of the Sodium to over 1000°K causing it to vaporise and its pressure to increase to over 20 kiloPascals. At the cold side of the device, heat is rejected so that the temperature falls to below 700°K and the pressure correspondingly falls to  less than 100 Pascals. Despite it being the \"cold\" side, the temperature is still relatively high because the Sodium must be kept in liquid form. At the anode surface of the BASE the neutral Sodium atoms in the vapour are ionised releasing electrons. ( Oxidation - the atom loses an electron) The resulting Sodium ions absorb the latent heat of vaporisation. Due to the high pressure difference across\\r\\n                            the BASE and its differential conductivity between electrons and ions, the positive Sodium ions are diffused through the BASE to the cathode while the electrodes provide a conduction path for the free electrons to pass instead through the external load doing useful work on their way to the cathode where they are recombined with the Sodium ions to reform neutralised metallic Sodium vapour. ( Reduction - the ion gains an electron) At the cold side the vapour releases its latent heat of vaporisation and is condensed to liquid Sodium which is transported back to the hot side by an electromagnetic pump, or in small systems, by a simple, passive wick mechanism. Back at the hot side the Sodium is vaporised once more in an evaporator and the cycle starts again. The output voltage generated between the electrodes is between 1.4 and 1.6 Volts DC. The system has no moving parts and will continue to generate electricity so long as heat is https://www.mpoweruk.com/amtec.htm] [URL: https://www.mpoweruk.com/amtec.htm]'},\n",

              "  'answer': 'I have been asking myself that very question a lot, particularly over the past 6 months.\\n Discussing my apprehension about continuing to train as a doctor is not easy. Imagine being in a field that you know, deep down, you were born to be in. Where everything just clicks, and does so with such vivacity that no matter what happens, you know that everything will be alright because you have THAT to fall back on. But, at the same time, you know that it is slowly killing you. I don’t mean to sound cliche - I honestly mean that in some form, it is killing me. Physiologically, psychologically - it’s doing its worst.\\n I am obsessive about the content, and as such, I self-impose far too much stress. I tend to manifest perfectionist behaviour, and that hamstrings me to the point where everything must be sorted and neat (or, at the very least, have the capacity to become ordered); I know now that this approach won’t work in the long run, as it is just not sustainable. I place too much of an emphasis on continual learning, to such a degree where I can’t unwind without feeling like I am wasting valuable time that could be spent studying or researching. Objectively, I know all of these signs fit into obsessive-compulsive syndromes, and perhaps even into the realm of anxiety disorders. I could attempt to lessen the effect of these behavioural quirks on my psyche, but at the end of the day, they have made me into a highly effective individual. Do I take that trade off, or do I continue as-is? It is incredibly hard to admit to yourself that the thing that you love, much like taking too much of a drug, is wasting away at your soul.\\n The literature and media are both starting to reflect the reality of what it’s like to work as a physician, and the results aren’t pretty; depression and anxiety plague physicians/clinicians in far higher rates than the general population. And all this is entirely unsurprising, what with steadily declining job security, increasing work hours, poorer working conditions, and less pay.\\nTime Magazine, 2015\\n I am at the stage of my training where work is starting to follow me home, predominately in the form of research. I’m not yet practicing in a clinical setting, but I can already envision being on-call whilst I am at home, spending time with loved ones. The thought of that, whilst exciting, does make me stop and think about whether I want to put that sort of strain on my personal life. Whether, at the end of the day, sacrificing all that is worth it for a stellar career - which, by and large, will be forgotten within a few generations (if not less). So, that calls two things into question: What do I actually want to do with my life, and what am I willing to sacrifice for it as a result?\\n There’s absolutely nothing wrong with “going career”. Just so long as you know that, in all honesty, you may one day turn around at 65 and regret the last 30–40 years of your life. That your stellar career will not be there for you on your deathbed, and that your partner, if you’re lucky enough to have snagged one in the early days, may not be either. Odds are, they divorced you, or you divorced them. For women, the trade-offs are even harsher - choose between having kids, or focusing on career progression (and sometimes to the detriment of your partner)\\n[LINKED_TEXT: [1]] [URL: #mawKU].

This includes understanding the statistics, injuries, and other factors that may impact the outcome of a game.Setting a budget: It's important to set a budget for your betting and stick to it. This means determining how much you can afford to lose and not exceeding that amount. It's also important to avoid chasing your losses, as this can lead to impulsive and irrational betting decisions.Avoiding emotional betting: It's common for sports fans to bet on their favorite teams or players, but this can lead to emotional betting decisions that are not based on logic or analysis. It's important to make bets based on objective analysis rather than personal biases.Being disciplined with your bets: Successful sports bettors are disciplined in their approach to betting, making calculated decisions based on research and analysis rather than impulse or emotion. This means avoiding impulsive bets and sticking to a consistent strategy over time.Realistic expectations: It's important to have realistic expectations when it comes to sports betting. While it's possible to make money from betting on sports, it's important to understand that there will be both wins and losses. Successful sports bettors are able to manage their expectations and maintain a long-term perspective.Shop for the best odds: Different sportsbooks may offer different odds for the same game or event. By shopping around and finding the best odds, you can increase your potential payout and reduce your risk.Focus on value: Successful sports bettors focus on finding value in their bets. This means identifying situations where the odds offered by the sportsbook are higher than the probability of the outcome occurring. By finding value bets, you can increase your long-term profitability.Manage your bankroll: It's important to manage your bankroll effectively to avoid losing all your money on a few bad bets. This means limiting the percentage of your bankroll you bet on any single game or event, and avoiding chasing losses by betting more than you can afford.Specialize in a particular sport: Many successful sports bettors specialize in a particular sport or league, as this allows them to develop a deep understanding of the teams, players, and trends that impact the outcome of games. By specializing in a particular sport, you can increase your knowledge and expertise, and make more informed betting decisions.Keep records: It's important to keep accurate records of your bets, including the amount wagered, the odds, and the outcome. This allows you to track your performance over time, identify areas for improvement, and adjust your strategy as needed.\\n\"},\n",
